# This script will build OpenThreads and OpenSceneGraph
# (using the Xcode projects I created for each) and package up 
# the Frameworks and PlugIns into a disk image (.dmg) for
# easy distribution. This script may be used towards automation
# of nightly builds.
# 
# The Xcode projects were designed so all three projects could be 
# built without any configuration or installation on the users end 
# if the directory structure followed this simple layout:
#
# AnyDirectory/
#   OpenThreads/
#     Xcode/
#       OpenThreads/
#         OpenThreads.xcode
#    OpenSceneGraph/
#      Xcode/
#        OpenSceneGraph/
#          OpenSceneGraph.xcode
#
# Simply put, the root directories for the 3 projects must be at the 
# same level. If you placed my Xcode tarball for each of 3 projects in
# each of the project's respective root directories, my projects should 
# extract themselves in the correct layout when you double click the 
# tarballs.
#
# You may place this script and run it from the same directory level 
# that OpenThreads and OpenSceneGraph exist in.
# 
# The script will build each of the projects, and then move the built
# files to a temporary subdirectory called PackageDir. A disk image (.dmg)
# will then be created containing everything in PackageDir. The 
# disk image is designed to be easily redistrutable over the internet.
#
# The end user simply needs to download the disk image, mount it, and 
# then go to the Frameworks folder and drag and drop all the frameworks to 
# a standard location. These might be:
# ~/Library/Frameworks
# /Library/Frameworks
# Or you may place them inside your application bundle e.g.
# YourApp.app/Frameworks
#
# Plugins are somewhat problematic. Though they build correctly,
# the code to locate the plugins from the "stardard" locations is
# incomplete. Currently, optionally installed Plugins like Demeter
# are not built.
#
# To build everything, you must have the Apple Developer Tools installed
# and you must also install Apple's X11 development package (if not 
# already installed). It can be found with the Developer Tools on the 
# last CD of the Operating System CDs.
#
# Also, since the code is C++, ABI issues apply. Since Panther is 
# gcc 3.3 based, the expectation is that the binaries produced 
# will require 3.3 compatibility.
