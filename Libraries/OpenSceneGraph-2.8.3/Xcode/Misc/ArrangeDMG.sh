# This is a stripped down version of my original Build_OSG_OSX.sh
# script. This just copies all the already built binaries 
# into a structure that is near-ready for distribution.
# 
# Usage: You should run this from the directory above the OSG-projects
# ("AnyDirectory" in the picture below)
# bash OpenSceneGraph/Xcode/Misc/ArrangeDMG.sh
#
# The Xcode projects were designed so all three projects could be 
# built without any configuration or installation on the users end 
# if the directory structure followed this simple layout:
#
# AnyDirectory/
#   OpenThreads/
#     Xcode/
#       OpenThreads/
#         OpenThreads.xcode
#    OpenSceneGraph/
#      Xcode/
#        OpenSceneGraph/
#          OpenSceneGraph.xcode
#
# Simply put, the root directories for the 3 projects must be at the 
# same level. If you placed my Xcode tarball for each of 3 projects in
# each of the project's respective root directories, my projects should 
# extract themselves in the correct layout when you double click the 
# tarballs.
#
# You may place this script and run it from the same directory level 
# that OpenThreads and OpenSceneGraph exist in.
