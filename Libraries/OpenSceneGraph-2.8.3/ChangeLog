	* src/OpenThreads/win32,
	  src/OpenThreads/win32/Win32ConditionPrivateData.h: From David
	  Fries, "Here is a fix for a deadlock seen under Windows using
	  OpenThreads
	  Barrier operations. The error is with atomic operations in the
	  win32 condition implementation. The attached sample program will
	  reliably trigger with as few as three threads and a dual core
	  system,
	  though sometimes it will take 65,000 iterations.
	  
	  2.8.1 was the base for these changes
	  
	  Win32ConditionPrivateData.h
	  Win32ConditionPrivateData::wait does two operations to decrement
	  waiters_ then read, when InterlockedDecrement decrements and
	  returns
	  the value in one operation. The two operations allows another
	  thread
	  to also decrement with both getting 0 for an answer.
	  
	  Win32ConditionPrivateData::broadcast is using waiters_ directly
	  instead of using the w value read earlier, if it was safe to use
	  waiters_ directly there would be no need for InterlockedGet or w.
	  
	  overview of deadlock in barrier with three threads
	  one thread in broadcast, 2 threads in wait,
	  release semaphore 2, waits on waiters_done_
	  both threads wake, decrement waiters_, get 0 for w,
	  <logic error here>
	  one calls set waiters_done_,
	  broadcast thread comes out of waiters_done_,
	  other thread calls waiters_done_, (which leaves waiters_done_ in
	  the
	  signaled state)
	  <sets the trap>
	  broadcast thread returns releases mutex, other threads get
	  mutex and also return,
	  next barrier, first two threads enter wait, one goes to
	  broadcast, release
	  semaphore 2, skips waiters_done_ as it had been released last
	  time
	  returns, processes, enters the barrier for the next barrier
	  operation
	  and waits,
	  three threads are now in wait, two have the previous barrier
	  phase,
	  one the current phase, there's one count left in the semaphore
	  which a
	  thread gets, returns, enters the barrier as a waiter, sleeps, and
	  the
	  deadlock is completed"

	  in the latest version.
	  
	  I found that changing the alignment of a text object does not
	  work properly if the text contains newline characters. I've
	  attached a simple test case that shows the problem. If I set the
	  text AFTER setting the alignment, everything works fine. But if I
	  set the text BEFORE setting the alignment then the text is
	  displayed incorrectly.
	  
	  The fix is very simple. Instead of calling computePositions() in
	  TextBase::setAlignment(), it calls computeGlyphRepresentation().

	  return from the constructor if this is missing.
	  As far as I read the standard extension documents, this blit call
	  is not

	  src/osgWrappers/osg/Vec4ub.cpp: From Paul Obermeier, "Please find
	  enclosed some changed OSG header files.
	  The changes are more or less just beautifications
	  (when looked at them from the C++ view), but make
	  wrapping OSG with SWIG easier.
	  I have tested the changes with both 2.8.1-rc4 and the
	  current head and would appreciate to incorporate the
	  changes in both branches.
	  
	  Here is a description of the changes:
	  
	  osg/BoundingSphere:
	  Use the following typedef (like used in BoundingBox)
	  typedef typename VT::value_type value_type;
	  instead of
	  typedef typename vec_type::value_type value_type;
	  
	  SWIG reports errors on the latter construct.
	  Also makes it consistent with BoundingBox.
	  
	  
	  osg/Vec4ub:
	  Consistent use of "value_type" throughout the file.
	  
	  
	  osg/Vec?b:
	  Consistent use of "value_type" throughout the files.
	  
	  Also changed
	  typedef char value_type;
	  to
	  typedef signed char value_type;
	  
	  In the case of a simple "char", SWIG assumes a string.
	  Using "signed char" instead of "char" does not change
	  the behaviour of the class."

	* src/osgTerrain, src/osgTerrain/Layer.cpp: From Ross Anderson,
	  "Symptom: The computation of TerrainTiles containing only image
	  layers (no elevation layer) is incorrect. The resulting bounding
	  sphere will always have a radius of zero.
	  
	  The fix is to remove the call to bs.expandBy(v) and compute the
	  radius directly. I believe this call was intended to be
	  bs.expandRadiusBy(v), but it is superfluous when the radius is
	  computed directly.

	* src/OpenThreads/win32, src/OpenThreads/win32/Win32Thread.cpp:
	  From Thibault Genessay, "On Windows, when a process tries to
	  spawn one too many thread,
	  _beginthreadex() fails but OpenThreads still waits on the startup
	  Block before returning to the caller of
	  OpenThreads::Thread::start().
	  This causes a deadlock. The return value of _beginthreadex() is
	  actually checked, but after the call to
	  OpenThreads::Block::block() so
	  it is basically useless.
	  
	  Attached is a fix to move the check for the return value of
	  _beginthreadex() before the call to block(), so that start() can
	  return to the caller with a non-zero error code. This solves the
	  problem for me."

	  StateSets attached to Geodes can be lost.
	  
	  The problem is in SpatializeGroupsVisitor::divide(osg::Geode*,

	  the input Geode into one Geode per Drawable.
	  
	  I fixed the problem by assigning the Geode's stateset to the new

	* src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt: From Frank Midgley, "I tried running
	  osgconv --formats yesterday on OS X and got no results. Turns out
	  the changes discussed in the "osgDB::listAllAvailablePlugins
	  win32 fix" thread back in Sep '08 broke this. The
	  OSG_PLUGIN_EXTENSION macro is being defined in
	  src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt from CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX which
	  is "dylib" on OS X. The problem is that all of the plug-ins are
	  setup in OsgMacroUtils.cmake with:
	  
	  ADD_LIBRARY(${TARGET_TARGETNAME} MODULE ${TARGET_SRC}
	  ${TARGET_H})
	  
	  which gives them .so extensions. Since ".so" != ".dylib"
	  osgDB::listAllAvailablePlugins finds no plug-ins. I believe the
	  correct solution is to use CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX instead.
	  This builds and runs correctly on OS X but I have not tested on
	  other platforms.
	  
	  Attached is an updated src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt based on rev
	  9915. The change is at line 108. To validate: build and then run

	  "in attach you'll find a patch to cleanup a little bit the
	  (de)initialization code of QuickTime? environment from the
	  quickTime pluging.
	  It basically removes the static init() and exit() functions,and
	  move them inside the observer class (the one that cleans
	  everything up when the last media is unloaded).
	  
	  It also add an extra check to clean up on exit if the QuickTime?
	  env is initialized, but no media is succesfully loaded / written
	  (it might happens with streaming resources).
	  
	  I tested it under WinXP with zero, one and multiple videos. "

	* CMakeModules/FindCOLLADA.cmake,
	  src/osgPlugins/dae/daeRMaterials.cpp: From Roland Smeenk,
	  "Attached are two small fixes:
	  -I changed the SET of COLLADA_BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR to use findpath,

	  against to precompiled boost libraries delivered with the Collada
	  DOM.

	  potentially uninitialized variable."

2009-02-09 21:53  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/osg/ReaderWriterOSG.cpp: From Bryan Thrall, "The
	  .osg plugin doesn't seem to support an option to write shader
	  files
	  separately, so it always inlines them in the .osg file (as far as
	  I can
	  tell). This change adds that ability. "
	  
	  Merged from svn/trunk.

2009-02-09 21:17  robert

	* src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp: From Ralf Habacker, "on
	  win32 there is a memory leak in recent svn code in
	  GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp.
	  
	  in bool GraphicsWindowWin32::setWindow( HWND handle )
	  
	  there is the following if/else statement
	  
	  if (_traits.valid() && _traits->setInheritedWindowPixelFormat)
	  ....
	  else
	  setPixelFormat()
	  _hglrc = ::wglCreateContext(...) [1]
	  
	  setPixelFormat() calls wglCreateContext() and saves the result
	  into _hglrc which is overwritten by a second call to
	  wglCreateContext() call at [1]
	  
	  The same behavior occurs in bool
	  Win32WindowingSystem::getSampleOpenGLContext( OpenGLContext&
	  context, HDC windowHDC, int windowOriginX, int windowOriginY ).
	  
	  The solution for this issue is to move the wglCreateContext() out
	  of setPixelFormat() and to place it into the caller which is done
	  to the appended file
	  "

	* NEWS.txt, README.txt: Updated NEWS and README dates for 2.8.0-rc3

2009-02-08 19:39  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: Fixed handling of making svn tags when on a
	  branch

2009-02-08 19:35  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: Changed the svn source from trunk to branches

2009-02-08 19:27  robert

2009-02-08 15:56  robert

	* examples/osgcompositeviewer/osgcompositeviewer.cpp,
	  examples/osgfont/osgfont.cpp, examples/osgmovie/osgmovie.cpp,
	  examples/osgocclusionquery/osgocclusionquery.cpp,
	  src/osgDB/DynamicLibrary.cpp: Form Paul Melis, "While trying out
	  the osgbrowser example (where I had forgotten to update
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the XUL libs would be found) I noticed that
	  although
	  the gecko plugin was found it could not be loaded. But this did
	  not
	  trigger any visible warning/error message (at least not without
	  INFO
	  notify level). Would you mind if we change the notify level for a
	  dlerror() to WARNING? This will also make it more explicit for
	  the case
	  when a plugin isn't actually found, which seems to come up a lot
	  for
	  novice users (e.g. no freetype on win32, so no freetype plugin,
	  etc).
	  Also, the current error message is misleading ("Warning: Could
	  not FIND
	  plugin to ...") because the it's not always a case of not finding
	  the
	  plugin. I slightly enhanced the situation of not finding a plugin
	  versus
	  finding it but not being able to load it.
	  
	  Here's also a few fixes to some of the examples:
	  - osgfont: make usage help line more in line with the actual
	  behaviour
	  - osgcompositeviewer: complain when no model file was provided
	  - osgmovie: don't include quicktime-dependent feature on Linux
	  - osgocclussionquery: comment addition (as I was surprised that
	  lines
	  were being drawn in a function called createRandomTriangles())"

2009-02-07 11:28  robert

	* src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Added merge.setting of StateSet during

	  src/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp: From Alberto Luaces, "here are some
	  minor fixes to notify warnings were the std::hex modifier was
	  used but never restored to the decimal notation. That made OSG
	  print messages
	  like the following after some notifications:
	  
	  Warning: detected OpenGL error 'invalid value' after

2009-02-06 10:12  robert

	* include/osg/Export: Added pragma disables for VS C4702 and C4511

	  src/osgAnimation/CMakeLists.txt: From Fabien Lavignotte, "Here is
	  some various small fixes i have done while playing with
	  osgAnimation.
	  - Animation : removed the _name attribute that is never used.
	  - BasicAnimationManager : fix a crash on Windows with the example
	  osganimationviewer. The _lastUpdate attribute was not initialized
	  when
	  using copy constructor.

2009-02-05 12:21  robert

	* examples/osgviewerQT/QOSGWidget.cpp: From Morne Pistorius,
	  "Attached is a modified version of the QOSGWidget example that
	  shows
	  the workaround we discussed for adding/removing views in a
	  composite
	  viewer at runtime. A dummy view is added to the viewer to always
	  keep
	  it live.
	  
	  Also, I added a #define to the Qt event relay methods to not
	  override
	  them on a Windows system. This fixes the bug where duplicate
	  events
	  are being sent and making it impossible to throw the trackball."

2009-02-02 14:43  robert

	* Refactored osg::TransferFunction1D to use an std::map internally

	  "

2009-01-30 14:54  robert

	* Added osgcluster example into build system

2009-01-29 11:18  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "Somehow, one of the shaders in the bsp plugin
	  started behaving incorrectly between the original submission and
	  now. I suspect it has to do with a typo in the setup of the
	  shader that was fixed at some point, or it happened during the
	  recent warnings purge. In any case, I had to invert the usage of
	  a parameter in the shader to make it behave properly again.
	  
	  
	  The vtf plugin wasn't working in Windows due to OS differences in
	  the byte-packing of the header structure (on Windows, the big
	  block read was causing a buffer overrun). I fixed this by reading
	  the structure from the file field by field. It's now happy on
	  both Linux and Windows."

2009-01-29 11:03  robert

	* Fixed warning

2009-01-29 10:43  robert

2009-01-29 09:28  robert

	* Improved the handling of toggling of GL_LIGHTi modes when
	  SceneView::setLightingMode() is toggled on/off.

2009-01-29 09:27  robert

	* Replaced -1 with ~0u to fix warning due to being written to a
	  UInt field. Note, OpenFlight spec says -1, which is clearly an
	  error in the spec, so we've had to guess at ~0u being an
	  appropriate value.

2009-01-29 09:24  robert

	* Removed now redundent shader files.
	  
	  Fixed the adding of transfer function property.

2009-01-28 16:48  robert

	* Removed old shader files

2009-01-28 16:44  robert

2009-01-28 13:45  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "1) Changes the order of the camera stats
	  slightly, to be more in line with
	  the view stats
	  2) Uses a slightly smaller block for view statistics"

2009-01-28 12:55  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, fixed typo.

2009-01-28 12:51  robert

2009-01-28 12:02  robert

	* Temporarily disabled VS warning C4100 to enable use to home in on
	  the useful warnings that could do with resolving.

2009-01-28 11:59  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "I have today built svn trunk on HP-UX
	  and Solaris8.
	  I had to do two small changes to src/osgWidget/Input.cpp and
	  src/osgAnimation/Animation.cpp mainly because of name lookup
	  problems.
	  "

2009-01-28 11:16  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, removed accounting of local to world
	  transform on the force vector as the particle velocity should
	  already been in world coords. Fixing this addresses a bug where
	  particles accelerated out of the scene rather than slowing down.

2009-01-28 10:06  robert

	* Added check against existing of a valid Stats object in
	  ViewerBase::renderinTraverls() to prevent crash.
	  
	  Added default View Stats into src/osgViewer/View.cpp to enable
	  stats to be collected for views

2009-01-28 09:42  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "this is a semi-submission based on what
	  you and others have been
	  talking about in the LIB_POSTFIX thread. It is a bit verbose
	  perhaps
	  and the message I emit during the make install step flashes by
	  and
	  gets burried under all "installing..." and/or "up-to-date..."
	  messages. I have posted on the cmake mail list on ways to do this
	  better.
	  
	  The submission adds:
	  * message to user during configuration that s/he's eventually
	  going o
	  install to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}lib${LIB_POSTFIX}
	  * if system has /etc/ld.so.conf.d and it is a dir generates
	  packaging/ld.so.conf.d/openscenegraph.conf and creates a custom
	  target
	  for installing it (target must be run explicitly of course). User
	  is
	  notified of this during configuration (may not be necessary)
	  * emit a message during installation that libraries are put in
	  <same-as-above>. This message unfortunately gets emitted to soon
	  for
	  the user to see it
	  
	  * I added "COMPONENT libopenscenegraph-dev" to the pkgconfig.pc's
	  install command
	  * Moved the section with OSG_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE as close
	  to
	  the end of CMakeLists.txt as I dared. This is the intent of this
	  construct I think."

2009-01-28 09:31  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is an updated osgViewer::StatsHandler. It
	  has the following changes:
	  - The text and dark background rectangles are now correctly
	  placed, and
	  slightly resized here and there.
	  - All counters (vertices, etc) now use a fixed formatting with 0
	  digits
	  precision, to prevent the text from being shown in scientific
	  notation
	  when the number get large (e.g. 6.34344e+6). I tested with a
	  scene
	  containing roughly 4 million vertices, to make sure its stats
	  would
	  display correctly.
	  
	  I also made slight changes to osgcompositeviewer (attached) to
	  aid in
	  testing the stats display, specifically displaying of camera and
	  view

	* From Patrick Hartling, "I encountered a bug related to RTTI for
	  subclasses of osg::Shape. The
	  circumstances under which this bug occur are rather specific, but
	  the
	  basic problem occurs when one translation unit other than
	  libosg.so
	  constructs an object that is a subclass of osg::Shape and another
	  translation unit other than libosg.so tries to perform a
	  dynamic_cast or
	  other RTTI-based operation on that object. Under these
	  circumstances,
	  the RTTI operation will fail. In my case, the translation units
	  involved
	  were an application and osgdb_ive.so. The application constructed
	  a
	  scene graph that included instantiations of subclasses of
	  osg::Shape.
	  Depending on how the user ran the application, it would write the
	  scene
	  graph to an IVE file using osgDB::writeNodeFile(). The
	  dynamic_cast
	  operations in DataOutputStream::writeShape() would fail on the
	  first
	  subclass of osg::Shape that was encountered. This is because
	  there were
	  two different RTTI data objects for all osg::Shape subclasses
	  being
	  compared: one in the application and one in osgdb_ive.so.
	  
	  The fix for this is simple. We must ensure that at least one
	  member
	  function of each of the subclasses of the polymorphic type
	  osg::Shape is
	  compiled into libosg.so so that there is exactly one RTTI object
	  for
	  that type in libosg.so. Then, all code linking against libosg.so
	  will
	  use that single RTTI object. The following message from a list
	  archive
	  sort of explains the issue and the solution:
	  
	  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/1688156
	  
	  While the posting has to do with Boost.Python, the problem
	  applies to
	  C++ libraries in general."

2009-01-28 09:06  robert

	* Added back in intializers for RenderSurface.

2009-01-27 15:35  robert

	* Removed .pc files as they are now automatically generated with
	  the correct values by Cmake from the openthreads.pc.in and
	  openscenegraph.pc.in files.

2009-01-27 15:34  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "I have modified CMakeLists.txt in order to
	  make CMake fill the existent
	  openscenegraph.pc and openthreads.pc files with OSG's
	  installation values.
	  Then I install those files into the expected path for pkg-config
	  (this can
	  also be modified through PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable).
	  Therefore
	  those of us who are using pkg-config for linking can easily
	  select which
	  version of OSG we want to use."

2009-01-27 14:11  robert

	* Converted viewer camera references to use observer_ptr<> rather
	  than ref_ptr<> or C pointers to avoid issues with circular
	  references/dangling pointers.

2009-01-27 13:23  robert

	* Refactored the view stats.

2009-01-27 09:09  robert

	* Commented out debug message

2009-01-26 21:23  robert

	* Ported onscreen camera stats across to using thread safe stats
	  collection

2009-01-26 19:22  robert

	* Added passing of command line args to cmake

2009-01-26 16:55  robert

	* Converted across to using ref_ptr<> to avoid memory leak/dangling
	  pointer issues.

2009-01-26 15:16  robert

	* Fixed effective leak in Program::PerContextProgram caused by
	  previously osg::State keeping a set of
	  std::ref_ptr<Program::PerContextProgram> without ever pruning
	  this list.
	  The fix was to convert the osg::State to use C pointers for the
	  set of applied PerContexProgram objects, and use the osg::Oberver
	  mechanism to avoid dangling pointers for being maintained in
	  osg::State.

2009-01-26 13:48  robert

	* Moved the XRANDR include into LIB_PRIVATE_HEADERS to avoid

2009-01-26 10:52  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2009-01-26 10:35  robert

	* From Rick Appleton, "In DatabasePager.cpp I believe there's a
	  copy-paste ommission. A little bit further down the file where
	  the Drawables are compiled the code is similar to how I have
	  fixed the code here for the StateSets. If the DatabasePager
	  thread is supposed to pre-compile things, it will call the
	  compileGLObjects such that compileAll will be true. However, when
	  compiling StateSets compileAll isn't currently checked."

2009-01-24 10:02  robert

	* Changed META_NodeVisitor usage to META_Object as it's more
	  appropriate.

2009-01-24 10:00  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "OS X failed to compile AnimationManager
	  because of
	  the useage of META_Node-macro, but AnimationManager is inherited
	  from
	  NodeVisitor, so I changed the Macro to META_NodeVisitor"

2009-01-23 10:29  robert

	* From Mattias Froehlich, "To pass the Microsoft application
	  verifier we have tried to get osgviewer
	  working with that thing.
	  This is what was missing so far:
	  
	  Make win32 threads behave like the posix implementation when
	  setting thread
	  cpu affinity. That includes avoid setting thread affininty on a
	  non running
	  thread. Set that once it is running."

2009-01-23 09:24  robert

	* From Lionel Lagarde, "here is a correction on
	  osgVolume/Property
	  added OSGVOLUME_EXPORT to PropertyAdjustmentCallback

2009-01-21 19:02  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, "updated osgAnimation with the trunk here the
	  update:
	  
	  examples/osganimationviewer/AnimtkViewer.cpp:
	  - add option to display bone (--drawbone)
	  - dont crash if the file does not contains a
	  AnimationManagerBase, display the content only
	  
	  examples/osganimationviewer/AnimtkViewerGUI.cpp:
	  - adjust the path of image for the gui

	  setMatrixInSkeletonSpace instead of setBoneInSkeletonSpace
	  
	  include/osgAnimation/Skinning:
	  src/osgAnimation/RigGeometry.cpp:

	  "

2009-01-21 19:01  robert

	* Fixed compile errors for when ref_ptr<> auto conversion is
	  disabled

2009-01-21 18:47  robert

	* From Roger James, The changes are as follows:-
	  
	  1. Support for ambient occlusion maps.
	  2. A fix for the incorrect handling of normals on all geometries.
	  The optimizer usually fixed this bug so it probably was not
	  noticed very often.
	  3. A new option flag on the reader. "StrictTransparency"
	  // Process transparent and transparency settings according to a
	  strict interpretation of the spec
	  // See https://collada.org/public_forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1210
	  otherwise
	  // Jump through various hoops to accomodate the multiplicity of
	  different ways
	  // that various people have interpreted the specification
	  4. Handling of texures in the transparent channel. This is
	  allowed provided that they are the same texture that is specified
	  in the diffuse channel. Accomodating a different texture would
	  require use of programmable pipeline functionality which I have
	  tried to avoid.
	  5. Handling of <bind_vertex_input> elements.
	  ""

2009-01-21 18:34  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "got some feedback from J-S on the
	  packaging so I have changed the
	  name of the top folder in each package to OpenSceneGraph-x.y.z
	  
	  Noone else has had an opinion on whether compiler and it's
	  version
	  should be part of the package filename on their platform/setup so
	  I'll
	  leave it as is. That is - No action is taken for compilers other
	  than
	  msvc but one can easily add this information to the cmake cache
	  regardless of platform.
	  "

2009-01-21 18:23  robert

	* Replaced readImageFile() usage with readRefImageFile() to prevent
	  threading issues with caching of imagery in the osgDB::Registry
	  cache.

2009-01-21 17:10  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "I realized today that there is an issue
	  with the Registry changes I submitted to allow plugins to have
	  the first go at URLs.
	  
	  The code works fine as is if the format plugin is not already
	  loaded in memory.
	  
	  If a plugin is already in memory, say the PNG plugin for example,
	  then a call to readImageFile("http://server.com/image.png") will
	  return FILE_NOT_FOUND because osgDB::findDataFile will not be
	  able to locate the file. So the Registry::read method is
	  returning before the CURL plugin is given a chance to download
	  the file.
	  
	  I've made a few changes to the Registry to not return
	  FILE_NOT_FOUND if the filename contains a URL that fix the
	  issue."

2009-01-21 14:37  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "Minor change to the glPushAttrib(...) call

	  from osgvolume example into include/osgVolume/Layer.

2009-01-16 16:21  robert

2009-01-15 10:36  robert

	* From Rudolf Wiedemann, "attached is the osg::Camera class (based

	  methods
	  getProjectionMatrixAsOrtho()
	  getProjectionMatrixAsFrustum()

2009-01-12 11:34  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "'ve finally finished the rework of the
	  packaging support. It is
	  streamlined for tgz and has most of the features that Robert, J-S
	  and
	  Sukender requested in december. I have an idea of how to discover
	  the
	  vc80 sp1 or not but haven't had time to implement. The script is
	  completely reworked and now doesn't include cmakes' bundled
	  CPack.cmake script at all. In summary:
	  
	  * filenames are
	  <package>-<osgversion>-<platform>-<arch>[-compiler]-<configuration>.tar.gz,
	  ex. libopenscenegraph-2.7.9-Linux-i386-Release.tar.gz,
	  libopenthreads-dev-2.7.9-win32-x86-vc80sp1-Debug.tar.gz
	  
	  * targets (projects in msvs) are generated for each specified
	  component, a target that packages everything that is installed
	  (openscenegraph-all) and there's a target for running all other
	  packaging targets (Package ALL on msvs, package_ALL in unix
	  makefiles).
	  
	  * It is possible to set the compiler in ccmake (cmake-gui,
	  whatever you use)
	  
	  * the top folder in packages is the same for all packages
	  (OpenSceneGraph-x.y)
	  
	  * the packaging support is limited with cmake-2.6.0 and not as
	  dynamic. With cmake-2.6.1 and later building the gdal plugin (for
	  example) will create a package_libopenscenegraph-gdal target.
	  With
	  cmake-2.6.0 only the ones that are always built
	  (libopenscenegraph,
	  libopenscenegraph-dev, openscenegraph, libopenthreads,
	  libopenthreads-dev
	  
	  * i found a better way to decide whether cpack is available to
	  guard
	  the BUiLD_OSG_PACKAGES option"

2009-01-09 19:53  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Following reports by Alberto and Simon
	  this submission reenables usage
	  of cmake-2.6.0. As a side note I just installed cmake from the
	  ubuntu
	  repositories and got cmake-2.6.0-4ubuntu2 and this one produced
	  the
	  currect CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE (-O3 -DNDEBUG). This CMakeLists

	  tested on linux with cmake versions 2.4.8, 2.6.0, 2.6.2 and
	  2.6.0-4ubuntu2
	  
	  * Added quotes around CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS var to help cmake-2.6.0
	  pick up
	  that it really is a string value
	  
	  * Removed quotes around values that we set in
	  OSG_AGGRESIVE_WARNING_FLAGS. This makes
	  OSG_AGGRESIVE_WARING_FLAGS be
	  of LIST type so the foreach constructs can behave as I planned."

2009-01-08 10:34  robert

	* Moved supression of VS warning C4706 from the include/osg/Export

	* From Don Leich, "Here are a couple of fixes for the file
	  examples/osgviewerQT/QOSGWidget.cpp to
	  address some OS X issues. Most of these fixes were previously
	  submitted by Julian Scheid. However, this patch however should
	  not break the example for non-OS X builds and has been tested on
	  64-bit Linux as well as Mac OS X 10.5.
	  
	  o The value returned by QWidget::winId() is not usable as input
	  for
	  WindowData under OS X the way it is for both Windows and Unix.
	  Julian's fix
	  for this uses the Carbon API. Since the fix for X11 in unknown,
	  it is now
	  assumed that OSG has been built with
	  OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM='Carbon' for this
	  example to work at all when running under OS X.
	  
	  o The CompositeViewer version would hang on exit with the
	  original timer start
	  argument. Changing the argument value to match the non-composite
	  version
	  seemed to cure the hanging.
	  
	  o Julian's patch altered the setGeometry position to 30/30 in
	  order to see any
	  window decorations. I did not have this problem, but left his
	  changes intact.
	  
	  o The non-composite viewer needed it's camera initialization
	  defered until
	  after the ViewerQOSG's Qt base class had been initialized.
	  Otherwise, the view
	  did not cover the entire window.

	* From Sergey Leontyev, "Some minor(but important) bug fixes for
	  osgWidget:
	  
	  
	  
	  1. In WindowManager.cpp childRemoved method the second parameter
	  "end" is misleading and
	  
	  should be named "numChildren" instead. It represents how many
	  children to remove. As a result, the method was implemented
	  incorrectly and failed to remove UI objects. So I fixed it.
	  
	  
	  
	  replaced this:
	  
	  
	  
	  void WindowManager::childRemoved(unsigned int start, unsigned int
	  end) {
	  while(start < end) {
	  Window* window = getByIndex(start);
	  
	  if(!window) continue;
	  
	  if(_remove(window)) {
	  window->_index = -1;
	  
	  window->unmanaged(this);
	  }
	  
	  start++;
	  }
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  with this:
	  
	  void WindowManager::childRemoved(unsigned int start, unsigned int
	  numChildren) {
	  for (unsigned int i = start; i < start+numChildren; i++)
	  {
	  Window* window = getByIndex(i);
	  
	  if(!window) continue;
	  
	  if(_remove(window)) {
	  window->_index = -1;
	  
	  window->unmanaged(this);
	  }
	  }
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  2. in Input.cpp
	  
	  
	  
	  The cursor in Input did not get positioned correctly, probably as
	  a left over from the TOP LEFT origin system which is now BOTTOM
	  LEFT.
	  
	  in method positioned()
	  
	  replaced this:
	  
	  _cursor->setOrigin(x + xoffset + 1.0f, y - _cursor->getHeight() +
	  1.0f);
	  
	  
	  
	  with this:
	  
	  _cursor->setOrigin(x + xoffset + 1.0f, y + 1.0f);
	  
	  
	  
	  Now it is placed correctly.

	  I've made a small change to Registry.cpp that puts the CURL logic
	  AFTER the URL has been passed to the plugin rather than assuming
	  all URL's need to be downloaded by the CURL plugin. This way,
	  plugins can have first crack at the URL's, and if they don't
	  handle it the previous CURL behavior kicks in."

	  predefined camera viewpoints. I also added a new
	  MatrixManipulator to osgGA called CameraViewSwitchManipulator and
	  added usage of this to the osgviewer example. This manipulator
	  allows switching between the predefined camera viewpoints. The
	  current design limition I ran into is that a MatrixManipulator
	  only manipulates the ViewMatrix, but for this particular
	  manipulator I also want to update the projectionMatrix of the
	  camera when switching to a new viewpoint. This is not implemented
	  because I don't know what would be the best way to design it. Any
	  ideas?
	  
	  Furthermore Collada also supports orthographic camera's, where an
	  osg::CameraView only supports a perspective camera. Would it be
	  useful to create a CameraView with customizable optics for this?"

2008-12-20 13:35  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "'ve been busy working on the Source engine
	  plugins. There are several contributions in this submission:
	  
	  osgDB/FileUtils.cpp:
	  Needed this extra code to allow a true case-insensitive search.
	  This is because the HL2 map and model files are often sloppy with
	  case. For example, the file might look for
	  materials/models/alyx/alyx_sheet.vtf, but the file is actually in
	  materials/Models/Alyx/alyx_sheet.vtf. In case-insensitive mode,
	  the new code recursively disassembles the path and checks each
	  path element without regard to case. In case-sensitive mode, the
	  code behaves exactly as it used to. The new code is also mostly
	  skipped on Windows because of the case-insensitive file system.
	  Previously, I did all of this with custom search code in the .bsp
	  plugin, but this allows the user to tailor the search using
	  OSGFILEPATH. There are some instructions in the plugins' README
	  files about this.
	  
	  osgPlugins/mdl:
	  This is a new plug-in for Half-Life 2 models (as opposed to
	  maps). This allows you to load Source models individually, as
	  well as allowing the .bsp plugin to load models (props) that are
	  embedded into maps. Mdl files can contain simple object (crates,
	  barrels, bottles), as well as fully articulated characters with
	  skeletal animations. Currently, it can load the simple objects.
	  It can also load the characters, but it can't load the skeletons
	  or animations.
	  
	  osgPlugins/bsp:
	  This contains all of the changes needed to load props along with
	  the basic map geometry. There are also
	  several bugs fixed.
	  
	  osgPlugins/vtf:
	  This is the loader for Valve's texture format. Previously, we had
	  agreed to put this in with the bsp plugin, but I didn't think of
	  the .mdl plugin at that time. It's conceivable that a user might
	  want to load models individually (not as part of a map), so the
	  vtf reader does have to be separate. I also fixed a rather
	  significant bug.
	  
	  I tested all of this code on RHEL 5.2 (32-bit), and Fedora 9
	  (64-bit). I'll be testing on Windows soon.
	  
	  I also attached a simple .mdl file, along with it's associated
	  files and textures. Just extract the tarball into it's own
	  directory, set your OSGFILEPATH to point at that directory, and
	  load the model like this:
	  
	  osgviewer models/props_junk/gascan001a.mdl"

	* From Jean-Sebastein Guay, I recently had to reimplement screen
	  capture functionality into our framework (which was broken since
	  the switch from OSG 1.2 to 2.2 over a year and a half ago). I
	  used the ScreenCaptureHandler which I had contributed right
	  before OSG 2.6 shipped, bit I had to trigger the screen capture
	  programatically instead of by a key press in some cases, so I
	  added a convenience method to do that.
	  
	  It's a minimal change, it just calls an already existing
	  protected method. It was trivial to subclass the handler to do it
	  in our code, but pushing the change into OSG makes sense as it's
	  generally useful to have it in the handler itself.
	  
	  I also noticed that the handle() method was overridden from
	  osgGA::GUIEventHandler but wasn't marked virtual. It wasn't
	  intended that subclasses not be able to override it in turn, so
	  I've added the keyword.""

	  On OpenThreads win32 implementation we unconditionally unlock a
	  mutex in the
	  destructor. That happens even if the mutex was not locked before.
	  When running a osg application within microsofts application
	  verifier, that
	  software checks tells me that we should not unlock an unlocked
	  mutex.
	  
	  When I look at the posix threads mutex implementation, which does
	  no unlock in
	  the destructor and where it is illegal to destroy a locked mutex,
	  I conclude
	  that it is not needed for an OpenThreads::Mutex to do that unlock
	  in the
	  win32 Mutex destructor.
	  
	  Thus this patch based on rev 9358 removes that additional unlock

	* Limited the static build to just osversion and osgstaticviewer

2008-12-15 19:37  robert

	* Aded osg::isGLExtensionOrVersionSupported(uint contextID, char*
	  extensionName, float minVersionRequired) method that
	  returns true if (the extension string is supported or GL version
	  is greater than or equal to a specified version) and
	  non extension disable is used. This makes it possible to disable
	  extensions that are now
	  available as parts of the core OpenGL spec.
	  
	  Updated Texture.cpp is use this method.

2008-12-15 16:42  robert

	* From Peter Hrenka, "I implemented a free list reallocation scheme
	  in
	  VertexBufferObject::compileBuffer().
	  
	  The offsets of newly added Arrays were not properly
	  calculated. This submission tries to find a
	  matching empty slot when the total size of
	  the VBO has not changed (e.g. when an array
	  is replaced by another array of the same size).
	  
	  
	  This fixes the overwriting issue that I showed in my posting
	  "Bug in VertexBufferObject::compileBuffer" on OSG-Users.
	  "

2008-12-15 16:41  robert

	* Reduced the default number _targetMaximumNumberOfPageLOD to 300

	* From Mathias Helsing, "Cpack support submission with:
	  
	  Better package naming. example
	  openscenegraph-core-2.7.7-Linux-i386.tar.gz on my ubuntu laptop
	  and

	  On windows with visual studio the OsgCPack script make some

2008-12-12 11:01  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "I have developed the earlier cpack example
	  a bit. Perhaps you could
	  consider these initial cpack support scripts. It is hidden behind
	  a
	  BUILD_PACKAGES option so won't affect the normal user. The
	  submission
	  1) set the COMPONENT attribute on all cmake install commands.
	  COMPONENT names are according to
	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Community/Packaging
	  
	  2) provide cmake script and a template for creating CPack
	  configuration files. It will generate target for creating
	  packages
	  with everything that gets "installed" (make package on unx,
	  project
	  PACKAGE in MSVC) plus targets for generating one package per
	  COMPONENT
	  (i.e. libopenscenegraph-core etc.).
	  
	  I have temporariliy uploaded some examples to
	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Community/People/MattiasHelsing
	  
	  If this submission makes it into svn we can develop it to
	  generate
	  rpms, installers for windows and mac (I know at least J-S don't
	  like
	  these but there may be others who do ;) and even DEBs (not sure
	  if we
	  can make them "ubuntu-ready" but they eventually may - at least
	  we
	  could put a deb on the website)"

2008-12-10 10:13  robert

	* From Andreas Goebel, (submitted by Paul Martz) "A fix for the FLT
	  exporter. This change adds support for normals with OVERALL
	  binding (and improves support for normals with PER_PRIMITIVE
	  binding -- still not correct, but at least it doesn't index off
	  the end of the array anymore)."

2008-12-10 10:10  robert

	* From Marcin Prus, "some time ago there was an optimization fix
	  including change in DirectionalSector::computeMatrix().
	  Rotation matrices were replaced with quaternions but incorrect
	  contructor was used. There was a call to Quat(angle, xAxis,
	  yAxis, zAxis ) but there is no such constructor in Quat class to
	  create quaternion for rotation. As a result we got this values
	  being written into quaternion directly.
	  
	  I've replaced Quat contructor calls with the ones creating
	  rotation quaternions Quat( angle, Vec3( axis ) )."

2008-12-03 14:13  robert

	* From Sukender, (Benoit Neil) "adding a few convinience methods to

2008-12-03 12:09  robert

	* From Ferdi Smit, "Image.cpp didn't handle the integer data types
	  correctly in the function:
	  
	  unsigned int Image::computeNumComponents(GLenum pixelFormat)
	  
	  so I added these types to the switch statement:

2008-12-02 10:42  robert

	* Revised the DYNAMIC vs STATIC library setup of COLLADA.

2008-12-02 09:00  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, build fix

2008-12-01 15:46  robert

	* Fixed wrappers

2008-12-01 14:07  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "Attachment is a plugin reading Biovision
	  hierarchical files (.BVH) to generate character motion
	  animations. BVH format is widely used by Character Studio of
	  3dsmax, MotionBuilder and other softwares, also supported by most
	  motion capture devices. The plugin is based on the latest
	  osgAnimation library of OSG 2.7.6 and will return a
	  osgAnimation::AnimationManager pointer if using readNodeFile() to
	  load it.
	  
	  Source and CMake files are:
	  
	  CMakeLists.txt
	  ReaderWriterBVH.cpp
	  
	  Also there are 3 example BVH files. The first two are captured
	  from motions of human beings - maybe a kung-fu master here.
	  PLEASE use command below to see the results:
	  
	  # osgviewer example1.bvh -O solids
	  
	  This will demonstrate the animating of a skeleton and render
	  bones as solid boxes. Note that the motion assumes XOZ is the
	  ground and has an offset from the center, so we should adjust our
	  view to get best effects.
	  
	  You may also use "-O contours" to render bones as lines. The
	  viewer shows nothing if without any options because
	  osgAnimation::Bone does not render itself. User may add
	  customized models to each named bones as osganimationskinning
	  does to make uses of this plugin in their own applications.
	  
	  I was wondering to support a BvhNode in my osgModeling peoject
	  before, but soon found it better be a plugin for animation. A
	  problem is, how to bind real geometry models to the skeleton.
	  Maybe we could have a bindingToNode() visitor in future to find
	  geodes matching names of bones and add them as bones' children."

2008-12-01 13:47  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-12-01 13:28  robert

	* From Art Tevs, "here is a submission of an additional class of
	  PixelBufferObejct, which implements more general way of handling
	  with PBOs. Current osg implementation of PBO does use an attached
	  osg::Image to copy data from. This is somehow only one way of
	  using it and doesn't provide full functionality of PBOs.
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Descripton:
	  
	  The patch does provide a new class PixelDataBufferObject which is
	  capable of allocating memory on the GPU side (PBO memory) of
	  arbitrary size. The memory can then further be used to be enabled
	  into read mode (GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER_ARB) or in write mode
	  (GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER_ARB). Enabling the buffer into write mode
	  will force the driver to write data from bounded textures into
	  that buffer (i.e. glGetTexImage). Using buffer in read mode give
	  you the possibility to read data from the buffer into a texture
	  with e.g. glTexSubImage or other instuctions. Hence no data is
	  copied over the CPU (host memory), all the operations are done in
	  the GPU memory.
	  
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Compatibility:
	  
	  The new class require the unbindBuffer method from the base class
	  BufferObject to be virtual, which shouldn't break any
	  functionality of already existing classes. Except of this the new
	  class is fully orthogonal to existing one, hence can be safely
	  added into already existing osg system.
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Testing:
	  
	  The new class was tested in the current svn version of osgPPU. I
	  am using the new class to copy data from textures into the PBO
	  and hence provide them to CUDA kernels. Also reading the results
	  back from CUDA is implemented using the provided patch. The given
	  patch gives a possibility of easy interoperability between CUDA
	  and osg (osgPPU ;) )
	  
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  I think in general it is a better way to derive the
	  PixelBufferObject class from PixelDataBufferObject, since the
	  second one is a generalization of the first one. However this
	  could break the current functionality, hence I haven't
	  implemented it in such a way. However I would push that on a
	  stack of wished osg 3.x features, since this will reflect the
	  OpenGL PBO functionality through the classes better.

2008-11-30 16:33  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlien, "'m was getting a build failure from the
	  OpenEXR reader on Mac OS X. It was complaining about undefined
	  references to half::convert(int). I believe this is because the
	  EXR plugin doesn't explicitly link against the Half library.
	  
	  Attached is a modified FindOpenEXR.cmake module that locates
	  IlmIlf and Half, as well as a modified exr/CMakeLists.txt that

2008-11-30 15:56  robert

	* From Art Tevs, "here are a small extension to the osg::Image
	  class, which do computes data type from the given format, i.e.

2008-11-26 16:39  robert

	* From Tim Moore, "Double precision versions of BoundingBox and
	  BoundingSphere are useful for doing computations in world
	  coordinates, especially when working with a geocentric scene. By

	* From Andy Preece,
	  
	  "To reproduce the bug:
	  
	  1. Create a template osg::Sequence node (and underlying geometry)
	  but do not attach the node to the current active scenegraph.
	  2. At some point during the rendering loop (perhaps on a
	  keystroke) clone the sequence node (I use the call:
	  
	  dynamic_cast<osg::Node*>(templateNode -> clone( osg::CopyOp(
	  (osg::CopyOp::CopyFlags)osg::CopyOp::DEEP_COPY_NODES ) ) )
	  
	  3. Set the cloned sequence node duration to a value that makes
	  the animation run slower (i.e. 2.0).
	  4. Start the cloned sequence (using setMode()).
	  5. Repeat steps 2 \u2013 4 and observe that the cloned sequences
	  do not run slow but run as fast, appearing to ignore the duration
	  that has been set on them.
	  
	  
	  
	  Looking at the \u2018good documentation\u2019 (2.4 source code),
	  I see that _start is being set to _now (osg::Sequence::setMode(),

	* Added searching for OpenEXR

2008-11-26 12:35  robert

	* From Ragnar Hammarqvist, "I wrote an EXR image plug-in to osg, I
	  would like to contribute this plug-in to the osg project if you
	  find it useful.
	  
	  The plug-in is a wrapper around open-exr (http://www.openexr.com)
	  that consists of two projects, ilmbase-1.0.1 and openexr-1.6.1.
	  
	  I have only tested it on windows XP 32 machine. So there might be
	  some work making it work on other platforms.
	  
	  The plug-in supports writing and reading EXR files. When writing
	  it can use the data type GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB(se ilmbase-1.0.1) and
	  GL_FLOAT. When reading the data type always becomes
	  GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB. It supports textures with three and four
	  channels.
	  
	  When reading an exr file it automatically removes Alfa channel if
	  it didn't store any information."

	  From Robert Osfield, started work on ported it to other
	  platforms, but could fix some problems relating to error:
	  
	  ?Imf::OStream::OStream(const Imf::OStream&)? is private
	  
	  I'm checking in now so that others can have a bash at completing

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "The FindGDAL.cmake seems to be broken
	  in OSG 2.6.1 for locating gdal.h through enviroment variable
	  GDAL_DIR.
	  
	  Also, I've modified the FindCOLLADA.cmake to locate the current
	  2.1 versions of the COLLADA DOM in the build directories under
	  VC8. I've also added a COLLADA_LIBRARY_DEBUG spec. Other flavors
	  may be added depending on compiler version and DOM version."

2008-11-26 11:45  robert

	* From BjornHein, "attached a proposal for an extension for the the
	  stl-File ReaderWriter. It allows saving of an osg node tree as
	  stl file in ASCII-Format.
	  
	  Standard is to generate one stl file.
	  
	  With an additional option it is possible to write one file per
	  Geode. This option is not very "useful" for typical application,
	  I use it for separating and conversion of geometric data. So it
	  could be removed if considered to special."

	* From Jaromir Vitek, "In attachment are another fixes for using
	  packed depth+stencil (PDS).
	  
	  * When used PDS RenderStage::runCameraSetUp sets flag that FBO
	  has already stencil,depth buffer attached. Prevents adding next
	  depth buffer.
	  * Sets correct traits for p-buffer if used PDS and something goes
	  wrong with FBO setup or p-buffer is used directly.
	  * Adds warning to camera if user add depth/stencil already
	  attached through PDS.
	  * Sets blitMask when use blit to resolve buffer.
	  
	  There is also new example with using multisampled FBO."

2008-11-24 16:32  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I have restored MSVC disabled
	  warnings in osg/Export. Difference is they are now disabled only
	  when OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS macro is defined. This macro is
	  set through CMake options and autogenerated in osg/Config. Simon
	  suggested that it would be cool if we had more control over
	  selected warnings. I tried to learn how to make selection of
	  individual warning numbers possible, but had to gave up as my
	  cmake skills were not sufficient. The only way I saw this
	  possible would be adding one define for each MSVC warning number.
	  But many definitions seemed too be to much clutter for osg/Config
	  file so I rejected thar idea. For this it would be cool if
	  autogenerated Config entries could more powerful than simple
	  #define/#undef flags. Maybe Cmake gurus know how to do it.
	  
	  I have not reverted added Compiler options. I assume that one may
	  want to have warnings enabled for the application but may not
	  want to see them while OSG libraries and examples compile.
	  
	  Modified files:
	  
	  osg/Export - now explicitly includes osg/Config to make sure
	  OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS is read
	  osg/Config.in - declares OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS flag to be
	  added to autogenerated osg/Config
	  CMakeLists.txt - declares OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS as option
	  with default ON setting

	* From Jason Daly, "This is a plugin (two, actually) that will
	  allow OSG to load .bsp map files from Valve's Source Engine games
	  (Half-Life 2, etc.). One plugin (called "vbsp" to distinguish it
	  from the Quake 3 bsp loader) reads the .bsp file itself, and the
	  other ("vtf") reads the texture files.
	  
	  The set up for this to work is a bit more complex than most
	  files, since the engine expects all files to be in a certain
	  place, and it tends to mix case a lot. I tried to explain
	  everything in the VBSP_README.txt file."
	  
	  This plugin has been integrated with the pre-exisiting bsp

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "I noticed some regression in the BMP

	  simply crash.
	  
	  After taking a look at the current state of the BMP loader I
	  decided it might be worth a shot at reimplementing that part. For
	  example: the current loader doesn't properly handle 1- and 4-bit
	  files, incorrectly loads 16-bit files as intensity-alpha (they
	  are RGB555), is full of dead code, and generally not in very good
	  shape.
	  
	  Attached is my re-implementation for review.
	  
	  I've checked it against the test images from
	  http://wvnvaxa.wvnet.edu/vmswww/bmp.html and models that use BMP

	* From Danny Valente, submitted bu Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Some
	  context: In the past I submitted a fix to
	  osgViewer::CompositeViewer where events would get wrong input
	  ranges. Later, you made a change to set the eventState's current
	  graphics context to the current graphics context. However,
	  there's a problem in the sequence of events. Here's the recap
	  (doing a graphical diff with the attached file will show this
	  clearly):
	  
	  Before:
	  
	  1. if the camera is not a slave camera
	  1.1 set the eventState's graphics context to the current context.
	  2. if the current master view is not the view which has the focus
	  2.1 set the current master view to be the view which has the
	  focus
	  2.2 use the new master view's eventState instead of the old one
	  
	  Now as you can see from this sequence, the graphics context is
	  set on the eventState before switching to the view which has
	  focus (and thus using another eventState). So the new eventState,
	  in the case we need to switch views, will contain an old graphics
	  context, not the correct one.
	  
	  Just inversing these steps fixes the problem:
	  
	  1. if the current master view is not the view which has the focus
	  1.1 set the current master view to be the view which has the
	  focus
	  1.2 use the new master view's eventState instead of the old one
	  2. if the camera is not a slave camera
	  2.1 set the eventState's graphics context to the current context.
	  
	  Now, the eventState will refer to the correct graphics context in
	  both cases.
	  
	  Attached is a fixed CompositeViewer.cpp (based on today's SVN)
	  which does this. Note that some other things are done in the 1.
	  and 2. cases, but they have no influence on each other so they
	  can just be swapped without problems.

	  I suggest moving the definition of OSG_DEFAULT_LIBRARY_PATH

	* From Csaba Halasz, adding missing export directives

2008-11-06 13:57  robert

	* From Thomas Wedner, "use osgViewer::CompositeViewer with several
	  views. All views share
	  parts of their scene graphs. Within these common part some nodes
	  have
	  event handlers which use the action adapter argument to the event
	  handler to determinate which view received the event.
	  Here is the problem, osgViewer::CompositeViewer::eventTraversal
	  sets
	  the action adapter field in the EventVisitor always to the last
	  view
	  which received an event, instead of using the view which actually
	  received the event, so determination of the correct view does not
	  work.
	  I looked at the code a bit, and moved the code for setting the
	  action
	  adapter to a IMO better place"

2008-11-06 13:40  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertleinm "cmake 2.6 is having trouble on Mac OS X

2008-11-03 15:57  robert

	* Added vnc plugin.

2008-11-03 15:08  robert

	* Added sendPointerEvent and sendKeyEvent virtual methods to
	  osg::Image to
	  facilitate the subclassing of Image providing interactive
	  behaviours so as
	  used in the vnc interactive VncImage class.
	  
	  osgViewer::InteractiveImageHandler provides an event handler that
	  convertes osgGA
	  mouse and keyboard events into the coordinate frame of an image
	  based on ray intersection with geometry in
	  the associated subgraph.
	  
	  Changed the ordering of events processing in Viewer and
	  CompositeViewer to allow
	  scene graph event handlers to take precidence over viewer event
	  handlers and camera manipulators

2008-11-03 15:03  robert

	  server.

2008-10-31 12:03  robert

	  libries for implementing a vnc client
	  as an osg::Image with the vnc data stream going to it.

	* Updated ChangeLog, AUTHORS.txt and README.txt for 2.4.7 release

2008-10-29 11:51  robert

	* From Blasius Czink, "changed the CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_RUNS macro
	  slightly to avoid the compile problems due to bugged "intrin.h".
	  In such a case the mutex fallback will be used (see attached
	  file)."
	  

2008-10-29 11:15  robert

	* Warning fixes

	  From Robert Osfeld, added throw on uncompress error.

2008-10-27 19:59  robert

	* From Chris Denham, changed nested Camera intersection test so
	  that it requires the command line --relative-camera-scene to
	  enable it

2008-10-27 17:42  robert

	* Added --help-env docs for OSG_MAX_PAGEDLOD

2008-10-27 17:11  robert

	* Merged in comment split code from the old flt plugin so that FLT
	  comments string with returns
	  in them are put into separate description entries.

2008-10-27 17:09  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I am sending a really minor fix for
	  StatsHandler::reset method. We dynamically add and remove slave
	  cameras in our application. StatsHandler does not automatically
	  adapt to this situation, and we call StatsHandler::reset to force
	  it to update number of cameras and their graphs. Unfortunately,
	  if stats were already drawn, reset would not remove former graph
	  drawables and they would remain frozen below new stats. This
	  update fixes it.

2008-10-27 16:16  robert

	* From Chris Denham, default scene that tests the use of in scene
	  graph Camera which has a RELATIVE_RF ReferenceFrame.

2008-10-27 16:06  robert

	* From Chris Denham, fixed support of in scene graph osg::Camera's
	  with ReferenceFrame of RELATIVE_RF.

2008-10-27 15:26  robert

	* From Katharina Plugge, "I found a bug in the OpenFlight-Plugin.
	  When exporting to OpenFlight it could happen that palettes of an
	  external reference like the texture palette are set wrong,
	  because they are overwritten by parent settings (userData), which
	  actually do not refer to palette entries respectively ParentPools
	  (happens for example if a Transform is parent of a ProxyNode).
	  The static cast from userData to ParentPools should therefore be
	  a dynamic cast.

	  function FltExportVisitor::writeExternalReference( const

2008-10-27 13:09  robert

	* Various warning fixes

2008-10-27 11:49  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-10-27 11:08  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "This change is a result of a recent
	  thread on osg-users.
	  The semantic change that went into the ac loader with the past
	  patch was
	  incorrect wrt the document describing the behaviour of ac files
	  and
	  inconsistent with what ac3d itself displays for that files.
	  This attached change reverts the behaviour to the original one.
	  The
	  infrastructure to change this is left in place.
	  The change is based on rev 9045."

2008-10-27 10:42  robert

	* From Blasius Czink, "Among other things I added support for
	  atomic operations on BSD-like systems and additional methods (for
	  "and", "or", "xor").
	  "
	  
	  and a later post the same osg-submissions thread:
	  
	  "it's been a while since I have made the changes but I think it
	  was due to problems with static builds of OpenThreads on windows.
	  I was using
	  OpenThreads in a communication/synchronisation library (without
	  OpenSceneGraph). It seems I forgot to post a small change in the
	  CMakeLists file of OpenThreads. If a user turns
	  DYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS to OFF (static build) OT_LIBRARY_STATIC will
	  be defined in the Config.
	  Without these changes a windows user will always end up with a
	  "__declspec(dllexport)" or "__declspec(dllimport)" which is a
	  problem for static builds."
	  
	  And another post from Blasius on this topic:
	  
	  "I tested with VS2005 and VS2008. For 32 bit everything works as
	  expected. For x64 and VS2008 I could successfully do the
	  cmake-configure and then the compilation but I had occasional
	  crashes of cmTryCompileExec.exe (during the cmake-configure
	  phase) which seems to be a cmake bug. With VS2005 and 64bit cmake
	  does not set _OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED although
	  the interlocked functionality should be there. If I place the
	  source snippet from the CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_RUNS macro to a separate
	  sourcefile I can compile and run the resulting executable
	  successfully. Forcing OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED
	  (on VS2005/x64) reveals a bug in "intrin.h" which seems to be
	  fixed in VS2008 but not in VS2005.
	  
	  In case anyone is interested the lines:
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset(long *a, long
	  b))
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset(long *a,
	  long b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset64(__int64
	  *a, __int64 b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset64(__int64
	  *a, __int64 b))
	  
	  should be changed to:
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset(long volatile
	  *a, long b))
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset(long
	  volatile *a, long b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset64(__int64
	  volatile *a, __int64 b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset64(__int64
	  volatile *a, __int64 b))
	  
	  The worst thing that can happen is that interlocked funtionality
	  is not detected during cmake-configure and the mutex fallback is
	  used.
	  Which reminds me another small glitch in the Atomic header so I
	  attached a corrected version.
	  
	  
	  
	  Why is the OT_LIBRARY_STATIC added to the config file? It is not
	  needed anywhere.
	  
	  OT_LIBRARY_STATIC is needed if you are doing static-builds on
	  Windows. See my previous post on that.

2008-10-27 09:48  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "I came across a bug when building
	  OpenSceneGraph with
	  MSVC_VERSIONED_DLL, NMake makefiles and CMake 2.6.2.
	  The compilation fails because it tries to copy
	  ot11-OpenThreads.lib to
	  OpenThreads.lib which is valid for the 2.4.x era of CMake but not
	  anymore in 2.6.x era.
	  The provided file from the CMakeModules directory adds a tests on

	* Improved the error reporting

2008-10-25 13:17  robert

	* From Jim Vaughan,
	  
	  - Matrix transform nodes were stripped out, and the
	  vertices and normals of each node were
	  transposed by the modelling matrix. My change preserves
	  the matrix transform nodes, so that
	  models can still be articulated by changing the matrices.
	  
	  - Lights were copied from the COIN scenegraph to the OSG
	  scenegraph, but they were not associated
	  with a LightSource node. My change for this creates a
	  Group and adds a LightSource for each Light.
	  
	  - If VRML textures have names, the name is now copied to

2008-10-23 16:33  robert

	* Introduced new method of management the number of PagedLOD
	  active, by using
	  a capping the number of PagedLOD to a sepcified maximum, with
	  pruning of inactive
	  PagedLOD when the total number of inactive and active PagedLOD
	  goes above the maximum.
	  
	  To enable the mode set the env var OSG_MAX_PAGEDLOD to a value

2008-10-21 16:39  robert

	* From Panagiotis Koutsourakis, "We are using Open Scene Graph for
	  an application and we need COLLADA
	  support. While testing the pluggin we found a small bug and we
	  are
	  submitting a patch.
	  
	  The first attachment is a small program that creates a scene with
	  two
	  pyramids, transformed by two instances of
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform. One of them is rotated 90 degrees
	  in
	  the X axis, and the scene is exported both in the native OSG
	  (.osg)
	  and COLLADA (.dae) formats. In the first case the rotated pyramid
	  is
	  displayed correctly whereas in the second the pyramid seems not
	  to be
	  rotated.
	  
	  In the COLLADA 1.4.1 specification (found at
	  http://www.khronos.org/collada/) it is specified that
	  "The <rotate> element contains a list of four floating-point
	  values
	  [...] followed by an angle in degrees" but the plugin seems to
	  write
	  the value in radians.
	  
	  The problem seems to be in the method daeWriter::apply() that
	  seems to
	  be writing the angle value in radians to the COLLADA file. The
	  patch
	  can be found in the second attachment and is simply a call to
	  RadiansToDegrees wrapped around the angle.

2008-10-21 16:32  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I made a minor tweak in
	  StandardShadowMap.cpp. As agreed with J-S I have added
	  AlphaFunc/AlphaTest to shadow camera stateset to make sure
	  transparent objects will not cast blocky solid shadows."

2008-10-21 16:31  robert

	* From Chris Denham, "However, just spotted another inconsistency
	  between UFOManipulator::getMatrix() and
	  UFOManipulator::getInverseMatrix()
	  It assumes that inverse(_inverseMatrix * _offset) = _offset *
	  _matrix
	  This is only true when _offset=identity, so I think it should be
	  inverse(_offset) * _matrix
	  This inconsistency can cause problems when switching from UFO to
	  other manipulators, because the UFO:Manipulator::getMatrix
	  function is not necessarily returning a correct inverse of the
	  currently set ModelViewTransform.
	  It was tempting to change the name of the _offset member to
	  _inverseOffset, or to maintain both variables, but in the end
	  went for the minimal change."

2008-10-14 16:57  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "Here is a small change to the CURL plugin
	  to distinguish between a 400 level error and a 500 level error.
	  
	  If a 400 level error occurs, a FILE_NOT_FOUND ReadResult is
	  appropriate.
	  
	  If a 500 level error occurs (such a 503, Service unavailable),
	  the application might want to try to load the file again in a few
	  seconds/minutes. This submission returns ERROR_IN_READING_FILE if
	  a 500 level error occurs so that clients can easily distinguish
	  between the errors.
	  
	  The actual error code is also added to the "message" of the
	  ReadResult so if a client needs more information, they can just
	  parse the message to retrieve the error code."

	* From James Moliere,
	  " The code below is to show how a heirarchy of objects can be
	  made within a scenegraph.
	  In other words, how there can be a parent/child relationship
	  between objects such
	  that when a parent is rotated or translated, the children move is
	  respect to it's
	  parent movement. A robotic arm is used in this example because
	  this is what I'm
	  using OSG for."

2008-10-07 13:37  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastirn Guay, "Inspired by the latest additions to
	  the StatsHandler, here is my own addition. It's a graph that
	  helps show the variation of the various stats over time. It's
	  clearer than just having bars for the last 10 frames or so, IMHO,
	  since 10 frames go by pretty fast...
	  
	  The graph is displayed "under" (behind) the normal bar chart you
	  get when you press 's' twice. It doesn't hide the normal stats,
	  you can still read them without any trouble, and that way, it
	  doesn't take any more screen space. It starts from the left, and
	  will scroll left when there is enough data to fill the screen
	  width. The graph lines have the same colors we're used to (except
	  I made the event color a bit bluer, so it's not exactly the same
	  as the update color). A screen shot is attached.
	  
	  The lines get a bit confused when they're all overlapping at the
	  bottom of the graph, but I think that's the least of our concerns
	  (if they're all at the bottom of the graph - except FPS of course
	  - then great!).
	  
	  The only thing I'm not very keen about is that to make things
	  simple, I clamp the values to a given maximum. Right now, the
	  maximums I have set are:
	  
	  * Frame rate: 100 fps (people have 60, 75, 85Hz refresh rates, so
	  there's no one right value, but I think 100 is OK)
	  * Stats: 0.016 seconds (what you need to get 60Hz minimum)
	  
	  This could be changed so that the scale of the graph changes
	  according to the maximum value in the last screenful of the graph
	  instead of clamping values. We would then need to display the
	  scale for each value on the side of the graph, because if the
	  scale changes, you need to know what it is at this moment.
	  
	  I tried to make things easy to change, so for example if you
	  don't like that the graph is in the same space as the normal
	  stats bars, it's easy to move it anywhere else, and make it have
	  other dimensions. The maximums and colors are also easy to
	  change.
	  
	  The impact on performance should be minimal, since it's one
	  vertex per graph line that's added per frame, and vertices are
	  removed when they scroll off the screen, so you'll never have
	  more than say 1280 * (3 + ncameras) vertices on the screen at one
	  time. No polygons, I used line strips. The scrolling is done with
	  a MatrixTransform."

2008-10-03 11:02  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "I had to make Yet Another tweak to the
	  workaround for the occlusion query issue on NVIDIA cards. Testing
	  indicates that this produces stable results. I checked this in to
	  the 2.6 branch as revision 8965. Please include this on the
	  trunk"

2008-10-03 09:55  robert

	* From Neil Groves, "Frequently I would like code that has a
	  signature like: void foo(osg::ref_ptr<osg::Node> node) to work
	  for osg::ref_ptr<osg::Group>, osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geode> etc. The
	  behaviour of osg::ref_ptr does not mimic the behaviour of a raw
	  pointer in this regard.
	  
	  To facilitate this possibility I have added a template copy
	  constructor and a template assignment operator. These work for
	  safe conversions like those in my previous example, but fail as
	  desired for non-safe conversions since the template instantiation
	  fails during the raw pointer copy/assignment.
	  
	  The lack of this facility has appreciably handicapped development
	  of generic algorithms applied to the scene graph, and I believe
	  that this alteration will be welcomed by most of the community.
	  If there are issues with antiquated compilers not supporting
	  template member functions then perhaps a small piece of
	  conditional compilation is in order.
	  
	  I have made the change using the latest release version (2.6) as
	  the base. The full file is attached.
	  
	  I have not tested building the osg wrappers and the script
	  binding code. I have tested the legal and illegal conversions of
	  both copying and assignment to ensure that behave as expected on
	  MSVC7.1, MSVC8, MSVC9, GCC 4.3."

2008-10-03 09:22  robert

	* From Tatsuhiro Nishioka, submissions posted by Stephan Huber,
	  "attached you'll find a modified ReaderWriterQT.cpp-file where I
	  removed the support for rgb(a)-files.
	  Quicktime supports only files with 3/4-channels rgba-files and
	  not 1/2-channels rgb-files.
	  
	  This submission is from Tatsuhiro Nishioka, here's his original
	  quote:
	  
	  When FlightGear crashes, the error message
	  "GraphicsImportGetNaturalBounds failed" shows up. By adding
	  printf
	  debug, I found the error was -8969: codecBadDataErr when loading
	  a
	  gray-scaled (2 channels) rgba files even though the file can be
	  loaded
	  with Gimp and osgViewer properly.
	  
	  So I made an investigation on this problem and found an
	  interesting
	  thing. This error occurs only when non-rgb files are loaded
	  before rgb
	  files. The reason is that rgba files can be handled by both
	  osgdb_rgb.so and osgdb_qt.so, but the error happens only when
	  osgdb_qt.so try to load a gray-scaled rgba file.
	  
	  When a program is about to load an rgba file, osgdb_rgb.so is
	  loaded
	  and it handles the rgba file properly. In contrast, when a
	  gray-scaled
	  rgb file is being loaded after a non-rgb file (say png) is
	  already
	  loaded by osgdb_qt.so, osgdb_qt.so tries to load the file instead
	  of
	  osgdb_rgb, which causes the error above.
	  
	  Anyway, the bad thing is that QuickTime cannot handle gray-scaled
	  rgb
	  files properly. The solution for this is not to let osgdb_qt
	  handle
	  rgb files since osgdb_rgb can handle these properly.

	* From Stephan Huber, removed now redundent setEventQueue method

2008-10-03 09:02  robert

	* From Roland Smeenk, A year ago Stephan Maximilian Huber sent in a
	  submission with enhanced statistics. Because I was interested in
	  the scene statistics of his submission I tried to merge his
	  changes with the current CVS head. I made a few changes to the
	  way the statistics are displayed. Attached you will find the new
	  StatsHandler and a screenshot of the statistics in the
	  compositeviewer example.
	  
	  This code will add two extra statistics options:
	  -Camera scene statistics, stats for the scene after culling
	  (updated at 10 Hz)
	  -View scene statistics, stats for the complete scene (updated at
	  5 Hz)
	  
	  Each camera and each view will expand the statistics to the
	  right.
	  
	  I also added the requests and objects to compile of the
	  databasepager to the databasepager statistics.""

	* From Mathias Froehlich, Wr.t AC3D Texture clamping "I had a quick
	  look at the problem.
	  Attached is a change that is able to provide shared textures for
	  the clamp and

	  So this appears to be the best fix I guess ...
	  
	  Also it additionaly shares the TexEnv StateAttribute in a whole
	  ac3d model."

2008-09-18 13:05  robert

	* From Chris Denham, "
	  I think I may have discovered a bug in osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp
	  that results in incomplete shadows being generated.
	  The problem seems to caused by an incorrect interpretation of the
	  spot light cutoff angle. The valid ranges for spot cutoff are
	  0-90 and 180, i.e half the 'field of view' for the spotlight.
	  Whereas the shadow map code seems to assume the the spot cutoff
	  is equal to the field of view. This results in the shadows
	  generated by the spotlight getting clipped at half the spot
	  cutoff angle.
	  
	  I have fixed this in my copy of ShadowMap.cpp:
	  ===============================
	  //Original code from OSG 2.6:
	  if(selectLight->getSpotCutoff() < 180.0f) // spotlight, then we
	  don't need the bounding box
	  {
	  osg::Vec3 position(lightpos.x(), lightpos.y(), lightpos.z());
	  float spotAngle = selectLight->getSpotCutoff();
	  _camera->setProjectionMatrixAsPerspective(spotAngle, 1.0, 0.1,
	  1000.0);
	  
	  _camera->setViewMatrixAsLookAt(position,position+lightDir,osg::Vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
	  }
	  ===============================
	  // My modifications:
	  float fov = selectLight->getSpotCutoff() * 2;
	  if(fov < 180.0f) // spotlight, then we don't need the bounding
	  box
	  {
	  osg::Vec3 position(lightpos.x(), lightpos.y(), lightpos.z());
	  _camera->setProjectionMatrixAsPerspective(fov, 1.0, 0.1, 1000.0);
	  
	  _camera->setViewMatrixAsLookAt(position,position+lightDir,osg::Vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
	  }
	  
	  This change seems correct for spot cutoff in the range 0, 90, but
	  since OpenGL doesn't claim to support cutoffs >90 && <180, I'm
	  not sure how shadow map should deal with those cases, but
	  ignoring spot cut off greater than 90 here seems reasonable to
	  me.

	  I have made the same changes in Registry.cpp that are available

	  following would suffice:
	  
	  IF(CYGWIN OR UNIX AND NOT WIN32 AND NOT APPLE)
	  
	  Sadly, it actually doesn't work, so I wrote a new conditional

	* From Christophe Loustaunau,"
	  I have found some errors on the example osgGeometryShaders. It's
	  about the varying in the geometry shader.
	  take a look at the varying vec4 v_color.
	  In the vertex shader, v_color is initialized to gl_vertex
	  then in the geometry shader v_color is initialized to
	  gl_PositionIn[0]
	  and in the fragment shader v_color is used as the fragment color.
	  
	  Try to initialized v_color to vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) in the
	  vertex shader and comment the line :
	  " v_color = v;\n" in the geometry shader, and you will see the
	  lines as black !
	  
	  It's because you have to use keywords in and out.
	  
	  extract from :
	  http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/geometry_shader4.txt :
	  
	  in - for function parameters passed into a function or for input
	  varying
	  variables (geometry only)
	  
	  out - for function parameters passed back out of a function, but
	  not
	  initialized for use when passed in. Also for output varying
	  variables
	  (geometry only).
	  
	  Then for a geometry shader, a varying must be an array :
	  extract from :
	  http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/geometry_shader4.txt :
	  
	  Since a geometry shader operates on primitives, each input
	  varying variable needs to be
	  declared as an array. Each element of such an array corresponds
	  to a
	  vertex of the primitive being processed. If the varying variable
	  is
	  declared as a scalar or matrix in the vertex shader, it will be a
	  one-dimensional array in the geometry shader. Each array can
	  optionally
	  have a size declared. If a size is not specified, it inferred by
	  the
	  linker and depends on the value of the input primitive type.
	  
	  
	  Here is a patch based on the svn version of osg that correct
	  that.

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "This is a generic optimization that does
	  not depend on any cpu or instruction
	  set.
	  
	  The optimization is based on the observation that matrix matrix
	  multiplication
	  with a dense matrix 4x4 is 4^3 Operations whereas multiplication
	  with a
	  transform, or scale matrix is only 4^2 operations. Which is a
	  gain of a
	  *FACTOR*4* for these special cases.
	  The change implements these special cases, provides a unit test
	  for these
	  implementation and converts uses of the expensiver dense matrix
	  matrix
	  routine with the specialized versions.
	  
	  Depending on the transform nodes in the scenegraph this change
	  gives a
	  noticable improovement.
	  For example the osgforest code using the MatrixTransform is about
	  20% slower
	  than the same codepath using the PositionAttitudeTransform
	  instead of the
	  MatrixTransform with this patch applied.
	  
	  If I remember right, the sse type optimizations did *not* provide
	  a factor 4
	  improovement. Also these changes are totally independent of any
	  cpu or
	  instruction set architecture. So I would prefer to have this
	  current kind of
	  change instead of some hand coded and cpu dependent assembly
	  stuff. If we
	  need that hand tuned stuff, these can go on top of this changes
	  which must
	  provide than hand optimized additional variants for the
	  specialized versions
	  to give a even better result in the end.
	  
	  An other change included here is a change to rotation matrix from
	  quaterion
	  code. There is a sqrt call which couold be optimized away. Since
	  we divide in
	  effect by sqrt(length)*sqrt(length) which is just length ...

2008-08-28 16:15  robert

	* Introduce the concept of layer set name, using the

2008-08-25 16:44  robert

	* Updated version number for 2.7.1 release, and added
	  OSG_FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL Cmake option
	  that enables the occlusion query workaround for an OpenGL driver
	  crash

2008-08-25 16:43  robert

	* From Doug McCorkle, via Paul Martz who writes : "Summary: Some
	  platforms/configurations cause application crashes if the
	  occlusion query result is not ready for retrieval when the app
	  tries to
	  retrieve it. This fix adds an application-level wait loop to
	  ensure the
	  result is ready for retrieval. This code is not compiled by
	  default; add "-D
	  FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to get this code.
	  
	  Full, gory details, to the best of my recollection:
	  
	  The conditions under which we encountered this issue are as
	  follows: 64-bit
	  processor, Mac/Linux OS, multiple NVIDIA GPUs, multiple
	  concurrent draw
	  threads, VRJuggler/SceneView-based viewer, and a scene graph
	  containing
	  OcclusionQueryNodes. Todd wrote a small test program that
	  produces an almost
	  instant crash in this environment. We verified the crash does not
	  occur in a
	  similar environment with a 32-bit processor, but we have not yet
	  tested on
	  Windows and have not yet tested with osgViewer.
	  
	  The OpenGL spec states clearly that, if an occlusion query result
	  is not yet
	  ready, an app can go ahead and attempt to retrieve it, and OpenGL
	  will
	  simply block until the result is ready. Indeed, this is how
	  OcclusionQueryNode is written, and this has worked fine on
	  several platforms
	  and configurations until Todd's test program.
	  
	  By trial and error and dumb luck, we were able to workaround the
	  crash by
	  inserting a wait loop that forces the app to only retrieve the
	  query after
	  OpenGL says it is available. As this should not be required
	  (OpenGL should
	  do this implicitly, and more efficiently), the wait loop code is
	  not
	  compiled by default. Developers requiring this work around must
	  explicitly
	  add "-D FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to the
	  compile
	  options to include the wait loop."

2008-08-25 15:57  robert

	  Note, Paul Martz has merged this patch into OpenSceneGraph-2.6.

2008-08-25 14:59  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-08-18 11:21  robert

	* From Sergey Leontyev, "1. In StyleManager
	  
	  
	  
	  when applying styles to a Label element the code below runs in a
	  infinite loop.
	  
	  The reason for this is that nothing increments the Reader "r" in
	  the case when applying a style to label,
	  
	  so I advance the reader when no match was found.
	  
	  ( To replicate the error apply style to any label)
	  
	  
	  
	  replaced this:
	  
	  while(!r.eof()) if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r)) inc = true;
	  
	  
	  
	  with this:
	  
	  while(!r.eof())
	  
	  {
	  
	  if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r))
	  
	  inc = true;
	  
	  else
	  
	  r.advanceOverCurrentFieldOrBlock();
	  
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  I tested it and it works well for me, I did not find any problems
	  with it.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  2. Added style support for Canvas element, event though there is
	  no styles to apply yet.
	  
	  It is usefull for someone who inherits from Canvas class to
	  develop another element.
	  
	  If applyStyle(Canvas) does not exist
	  
	  there is no way to apply style to the element that inherited from
	  Canvas element.
	  
	  
	  
	  Added virtual
	  
	  bool applyStyle(Canvas).
	  
	  
	  
	  and in added call to apply style if the Object is of type Canvas:
	  
	  StyleManager::_applyStyleToObject(osg::Object* obj, const
	  std::string& style) {
	  
	  ...
	  
	  
	  
	  else if(!std::string("Canvas").compare(c))
	  
	  return _coerceAndApply<Canvas>(obj,style,c);
	  
	  "

2008-08-18 11:17  robert

	* Ran fixtabs to enforce four space tabs

2008-08-18 11:00  robert

	* From Erik van Dekker,
	  
	  "I made several modifications:
	  
	  
	  
	  * The cause of my errors was that my OSG source directory path
	  contains spaces. To fix this issue I wrapped all paths with
	  quotes, as stated in doxygen documentation.
	  
	  
	  
	  * I also received some warning messages about deprecated doxygen
	  settings, which I fixed by updating the doxygen file, i.e.
	  running \u2018doxygen \u2013u doxygen.cmake\u2018. By running
	  this command deprecated doxygen options are removed, some option
	  comments have changed and quite some options have been added (I
	  kept their default settings unless mentioned).
	  
	  
	  
	  * I was surprised to find that the doxygen OUTPUT_DIRECTORY was
	  set to \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_SOURCE_DIR}/doc\u201d, which does
	  not seem appropriate for out of source builds; I changed this to
	  \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_BINARY_DIR}/doc\u201d. (On the other hand,
	  maybe a cmake selectable option should be given to the user?)
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed two warnings I received about unexpected
	  end-of-list-markers in \u2018osg\AnimationPath and
	  \u2018osgUtil\CullVisitor due to excess trailing points in
	  comments.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed a warning in osgWidget\StyleInterface due to an #include
	  directive (strangely) placed inside a namespace.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed a warning in osg\Camera due to the META_Object macro that
	  confused doxygen. Adding a semi-colon fixed this.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Removed auto_Mainpage from the INCLUDE option, because I am
	  positive that this file does not belong there; It never generated
	  useful documentation anyway.
	  
	  
	  
	  * I added the OSG version number environment variable to the
	  PROJECT_NUMBER option so that the version number is now shown on
	  the main page of generated documentation (e.g. index.html).
	  
	  
	  
	  * Changed option FULL_PATH_NAMES to YES, but made sure
	  STRIP_FROM_PATH stripped the absolute path until the include dir.
	  This fixed an issue that created mangled names for identical
	  filenames in different directories. E.g. osg/Export and
	  osgDB/Export are now correctly named.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Changed option SHOW_DIRECTORIES to yes, which is a case of
	  preference I guess.
	  
	  "

2008-08-18 10:47  robert

	* Removed todo entry

2008-08-17 16:52  robert

	* From Maceij Krol, "I have implement frame based expiration of
	  PagedLOD children.
	  
	  New attribute DatabasePager::_expiryFrames sets number of frames
	  a PagedLOD child is kept in memory. The attribute is set with
	  DatabasePager::setExpiryFrames method or OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES
	  environmental variable.
	  
	  New attribute PagedLOD::PerRangeData::_
	  frameNumber contains frame number of last cull traversal.
	  
	  Children of PagedLOD are expired when time _AND_ number of frames
	  since last cull traversal exceed OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY _AND_
	  OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES respectively. By default OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 1
	  which means that nodes from last cull/rendering
	  traversal will not be expired even if last cull time exceeds
	  OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY. Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 0 revokes previous
	  behaviour of PagedLOD.
	  
	  Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES > 0 fixes problems of children
	  reloading in lazy rendering applications. Required behaviour is
	  achieved by manipulating OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY and OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES
	  together.
	  
	  Two interface changes are made:
	  
	  DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(double currentFrameTime) is
	  replaced by DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(const osg::FrameStamp
	  &frameStamp). The previous method is in #if 0 clause in the
	  header file. Robert, decide if You want to include it.
	  
	  PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double expiryTime, NodeList
	  &removedChildren) is deprecated (warning is printed), when
	  subclassing use PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double
	  expiryTime, int expiryFrame, NodeList &removedChildren) instead.
	  "

2008-08-17 16:45  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "I've got a few machines that OSG
	  incorrectly believes support FRAME_BUFFER_OBJECTS so I am
	  manually trying to set the renderTargetImplementation to
	  PIXEL_BUFFER or PIXEL_BUFFER_RTT. I noticed that this call wasn't
	  setting the camera's overlay data properly because the
	  setRenderTargetImplementation simply calls init() which only does
	  anything for OBJECT_DEPENDENT_WITH_ORTHOGRAPHIC_OVERLAY. Any
	  subsequent calls to getOverlayData will simply return the cached
	  OverlayData instead of setting it up.
	  
	  My fix updates the camera's render target implementation for all
	  OverlayData objects in the OverlayDataMap."

2008-08-15 17:35  robert

	* From Jutta Sauer, "We added a raise window method to

	* Updated version numbers in prep for next dev release

2008-08-15 17:25  robert

	* From Frashid Larshkari, "I modified the vertical/horizontal
	  interlace stereo modes so that they
	  use the osg::State::applyMode for enabling/disabling certain
	  while
	  rendering the stencil mask. Previously some of these calls were
	  overriding the scene graph states because the global state was
	  not
	  aware of this change.

	* Added support for geometry shader attributes

2008-08-15 16:43  robert

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "I added the osg::Program parameters
	  support for the osg plug'in.

	  Notes from Robert Osfield, renamed the names of the parameters to
	  be less GL centric and more human readable.

2008-08-15 16:21  robert

	* Changed osg::ImageSequence::set/getDuration to set/getLength() to

	  broke material/texture loading for some files I have that specify
	  texture matrix scaling.
	  
	  The following link shows a very comprehensive list of .mtl file
	  options:
	  http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/mtl/
	  
	  Attached is a patch that should fix spacey filenames and optional

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Changes attached so that the

	  ScreenCaptureHandler (default 0 = default CaptureOperation). This
	  way, you can do:
	  
	  viewer.addEventHandler(new osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler(
	  new osgViewer::WriteToFileCaptureOperation("filename", "jpg")));
	  
	  and the filename will be what you want. The
	  WriteToFileCaptureOperation will add the context ID and the file
	  number (if in SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER mode) to the file name.
	  
	  (The attached also clarifies some notify messages, and corrects
	  the comment when adding the handler in osgviewer.cpp)
	  
	  I also remembered, the current architecture could allow a
	  different CaptureOperation for each context, but currently the
	  API only allows setting one CaptureOperation for all contexts.
	  This could be improved if need be.
	  
	  "

	* Updated ChangeLog for dev release

2008-07-12 12:00  robert

	* From Doug McCorkle, "Attached is patch that corrects/improves the
	  following issues with the OBJ loader:
	  
	  1. Added options to control wether the osgUtil::Tessellator or
	  osgUtil::TriStripVisitor are run. By default they still run just
	  as before.
	  2. Added support for the Emissive material. The data was being
	  read from the mtl file but was never being applied to the model.
	  3. This is the main bug addressed, when a model is read in with
	  an alpha value specified like:
	  
	  newmtl Material__8
	  Ns 24
	  d 0.33
	  illum 2
	  Kd 0.204 0.204 0.204
	  Ks 0 0 0
	  Ka 0.153 0.153 0.153
	  
	  where the alpha value is d. The loader would then overwrite the
	  alpha value when reading the diffuse, specular, and ambient
	  colors. I have changed all the material color readers to only set
	  the values they read and to use the default colors specified in
	  the constructor of the obj class. With these changes, the obj
	  reader now handles opacity correctly if the alpha value is
	  specified before the material colo"

	* From Liang Aibin, " In lastest svn version of OSG, the .ive

	  DataInputStream::readStateAttribute

	  "Opcodes.h:
	  * Added INVALID_OP as -1 in the Opcodes enum. Note that
	  INVALID_OP is not an actual opcode defined in the OpenFlight
	  format. The purpose of INVALID_OP is to mark an opcode variable
	  as invalid or uninitialized.
	  
	  ReaderWriterFLT.cpp:
	  * The header node is returned if it exists, even if the file does
	  not contain a node hierarchy. The old behaviour returned a

2008-07-11 16:48  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-07-11 16:48  robert

	* Moved the building and intersecting of the KdTree into the .cpp,
	  and cleaned up
	  the header to ready it for wider usage

2008-07-10 15:50  robert

	* Streamlined KdTree implementation

2008-07-09 19:43  robert

	* Cleaned up KdTree implementation

2008-07-09 19:41  robert

	* Reordered KdLeaf/KdNode so that the first element to be accessed
	  is first in the data structure

2008-07-09 19:40  robert

	* Introduced code for doing dummy test traversals - used for
	  benchmarking KdTree code.

2008-07-09 19:28  robert

	* Added range of camera manipulators and a center of screen test
	  intersection that
	  is insticated by pressing 'c' key

2008-07-09 19:26  robert

	* Introduce a intersecion performance testing code path, #if def'd
	  out for now.

2008-07-09 12:37  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-07-08 18:02  robert

	* Fixed set method

2008-07-08 17:35  robert

	* Added optional control of whether to use KdTrees for

	* Implement hierachy culling in KdTree::intersect(..)

2008-07-07 14:27  robert

	* Improved the handling of KdTree intersections

2008-07-07 13:21  robert

	* Implemented intial KdTree triangle intersection code, but without
	  culling implemented

2008-07-07 10:46  robert

	* Added KdTreeBuilder calls into FindCompileableGLObjectsVisitor,
	  and an alternative
	  path that explictly calls the KdTreeBuilde when required in cases
	  when no pre compile of GL objects is required.

2008-07-07 09:40  robert

	* Changed types to avoid warnings under Windows

2008-07-06 18:27  robert

	* Changed the DatabasePager so that it bypasses the
	  Registry::readNode() method and calls
	  readNodeImplementation() directly to avoid calling the
	  KdTreeBuilder.
	  
	  Updated wrappers.

2008-07-06 12:14  robert

	* Moved KdTree build code into osg::KdTree

2008-07-05 17:29  robert

	* Added handling of co-incident start and end points.

2008-07-05 16:39  robert

	* Ported intersection code to use new
	  osgUtil::LineSegmentIntersector/IntersectionVisitor.

2008-07-04 19:16  robert

	* Converted TerrainManipulator to use osgUtil::InterectionVisitor
	  rather than the
	  old IntersectVisitor

2008-07-04 17:02  robert

	* Added KdTree intersection support into LineSegmentIntersector

2008-07-04 15:57  robert

	* Added prelimnary KdTree data structure and automatic kdtree build
	  support
	  into osgDB::Registry/osgTerrain so that newly created subgraphs
	  can have
	  KdTree built on all osg::Geometry automatically on load/creation.

2008-07-04 11:51  robert

	* Moved vertex indicies method into a single block with deprecated
	  doc lines

2008-07-03 17:18  robert

	* Introduced bounding boxes to KDLeaf and KDNode structs

2008-07-03 15:49  robert

	* Added new data structure + build algorithm that places triangles
	  into leaves
	  without being shared, but with varying the boundaries of leaves
	  so that they
	  may overlap.

2008-07-03 15:01  robert

	* From Mario Valle, "xed the following warning on Linux 64 bits
	  Athlon:

2008-07-03 14:59  robert

	* From Mario Valle, removed extraneous spaces

2008-07-03 11:23  robert

	* Added header guards

2008-07-03 11:22  robert

	* Refactored example so that the example will be able to run
	  different kdtree data strucutres/algorithms.

2008-07-03 11:07  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "The check for Leopard to build 4-way
	  binaries by default was broken. Here is an updated CMakeLists.txt
	  file to fix the problem."

2008-07-03 10:24  robert

	* Implement an experiemental triangle kdtree building support

2008-07-03 10:03  robert

	* Set the DataVariance on FadeText to DYNAMIC to reflect their
	  nature

2008-07-02 10:00  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-07-02 09:25  robert

	* Introduced support for UNSCPECIFIED and STATIC DataVariance of
	  StateSet/Textures

2008-07-01 19:04  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "There is a problem reading bmp files
	  containing a colour palette,
	  due to an incorrect scan line length calculation. Attached is a
	  fix,
	  and a little bmp file which demonstrates the problem."

2008-07-01 18:37  robert

	* From Lilin Xiong, "I change ive plugin a little for osgText
	  inout, so the ive plugin supports backdrop setting,
	  and Text3D, FadeText inout :
	  
	  1. in DataInputStream.cpp, add 1286--1293 lines;
	  2. in Text.cpp, add some code for text's Backdrop setting;
	  3. in IveVersion.h, add line 39, increase the VERSION to
	  VERSION_028(line 41)
	  4. in ReadWrite.h, add line 146,147
	  5. add file FadeText.h, FadeText.cpp, Text3D.h, Text3D.cpp."

2008-07-01 13:56  robert

	* Added Vec3Array arrange pointer to avoid dynamic cast

2008-07-01 09:40  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "It appears not to be sufficient to set a
	  cmake variable to get a define in
	  such a config file. Instead set that variable to 1. Also included
	  a small compile fix, that appears to be required than ..."

2008-06-30 16:53  robert

	* Added guards against FBO not being supported/setup

2008-06-29 13:41  robert

	* Updated README date for 2.5.3 dev release

2008-06-29 12:22  robert

	* Changed the Optimizer::StateVisitor so that it can individually
	  decide whether
	  to optimize away duplicate state with dynamic, static and
	  unspecified DataVarience. By default
	  the code now optimizes away duplicate state with either static
	  and unspecied state, previously
	  it was just handling static state.

2008-06-28 16:59  robert

	* Added realize of new graphics contexts to handle new views being
	  added with
	  unrealized windows

2008-06-27 19:40  robert

	* Changed back to use an std::vector<> rather than a std::list for
	  RequestQueue to
	  avoid member template problems under Solaris.

2008-06-27 18:59  robert

	* Refactored the sort of the requestQueue so that there is single
	  code path for doing the sort.

2008-06-27 16:47  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Update to the configure check for msvc
	  7.1.
	  MemoryBarrier() is used in the implementation, so it should be
	  checked.
	  This in effect disables the faster atomic ops on msvc 7.1 and
	  older, even if
	  only the MemoryBarrier() call is missing. But it ensures for the
	  fist cut
	  that it will build everywhere. If somebody cares for msvc 7.1
	  enough and has
	  one for testing installed, he might provide the apropriate
	  defines to guard
	  that MemoryBarrier() call.
	  
	  I tested that msvc8 32/64bit still passes the configure tests and
	  compiles.
	  "

2008-06-27 12:44  robert

	* Simplified the MixinVector class so that it no longer supports
	  custom allocators,
	  instead just uses std::vector<>'s default allocators.

2008-06-27 12:35  robert

	* Moved the apply(&) default implementations from the header into
	  the NodeVisitor.cpp,
	  and changed the casts to use static_cast<>.

2008-06-27 11:47  shuber

	* from Stephan Huber: updated XCode project

2008-06-27 10:17  robert

	* From Andre Normann, "with version 8504, I am not able to compile
	  osgwrappers under Windows, because there are some DLL export
	  macros missing. I fixed it and put the files in the attached zip
	  file.
	  "

2008-06-26 19:51  robert

	* Updated authors and osgversion

2008-06-26 19:47  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-26 19:21  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-26 18:34  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The method
	  IntersectionVisitor::apply(osg::PagedLOD&) appears to attempt to
	  identify a "highest res" child of the PagedLOD and only allow
	  intersection on that child. The implementation appears to be
	  flawed in two cases:
	  
	  1) The "highest res" child is assumed to be the child with index
	  "getNumFileNames()-1" or "getNumChildren()-1". As a result,
	  PagedLODs that do not sort children from furthest to nearest will
	  intersect with the wrong child. (see attached "case1.osg" to
	  reproduce this problem.)
	  
	  2) The code assumes there is only one highest res child. As a
	  result. PagedLODs with multiple children at the same highest res
	  range can only intersect one of those children. ("case2.osg"
	  demonstrates this issue; you can only pick the quad on the
	  right.)
	  
	  I've attached a modified IntersectionVisitor.cpp that attempts to
	  resolve these issues. It identifies a highest res range based on
	  the range mode, then continues traversal on all valid children
	  corresponding to that range description. Only in the case of a
	  malformed PagedLOD does the code fall back to getting the last
	  child in the list.
	  "

2008-06-26 18:06  robert

	* From Morten Haukness, "When cloning effects osg crashes because
	  the copy constructur tries to run av pure virtual method
	  (setUpEmitterAndProgram). The right thing to do when cloning an
	  effect is to run the inherited version og buildEffect and
	  setUpEmitterAndProgram.
	  
	  "

2008-06-26 16:45  robert

	* Changed the removeCamera() method so that it now actively calls
	  releaseGLObjects()
	  on all children of a camera that aren't shared with other cameras
	  on that context.
	  
	  This change fixes problems with allocating and deleting views.

2008-06-26 15:06  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, updated CMakeLists.txt to build the
	  Atomic.cpp

2008-06-26 13:09  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowski, added enforcement of CMake 2.6.0 under OSX.

2008-06-26 13:08  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowski, Cmake support for osgviewerCocoa

2008-06-26 12:08  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, build fixes for various unices

2008-06-26 10:33  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, added do not edit comments to Config.in
	  so that the autogenerated
	  Config files have an appropriate warning notice

2008-06-26 10:27  robert

	* From Mathias Froechlich, "Attached is a change to that atomic
	  stuff to move the win32, msvc
	  implementation of the atomic increment and decrement into a
	  implementation
	  file.
	  This way inlining and compiler optimization can no longer happen
	  for these
	  implementations, but it fixes compilation on win32 msvc targets.
	  I expect
	  that this is still faster than with with mutexes.
	  
	  Also the i386 gcc target gets atomic operations with this patch.
	  By using an
	  implementation file we can guarantee that we have the right
	  compiler flags
	  available."

2008-06-23 15:11  robert

	* Fixed pedantic warning

2008-06-23 14:51  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "fixed win32/win64 configure check and
	  win32/win64
	  atomic related compile failures with msvs2005. Attached changes
	  to make win32
	  really use the atomic stuff. There are pointer typecast problems
	  and some
	  historic alignment restrictions that I just took from a previous
	  similar
	  implementation of mine without looking deep enough. "

2008-06-23 11:14  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "Suibject: CMakeList ADD_DEFINITION for
	  CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX broken
	  I needed a -DCMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX="d" not a
	  -D"CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX=d".
	  
	  This corrects the build for the CMake 2.4 and 2.6 series
	  
	  The error was in compiling osgDB/Registry.cpp
	  "

2008-06-23 10:18  robert

	* Commented out the explict install of the Config files as
	  including these files into
	  the header list allows the normal Cmake install support to
	  install them.

2008-06-23 09:57  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "I have made a number of changes intended
	  to get a few things working better on OSX. However, since I'm
	  still pretty new at Mac development and cmake I'm not entirely
	  certain that the changes I have made are benign on other
	  platforms. I have tested these changes on Leopard with CMake 2.6
	  generating Xcode 3.0 projects, compiling on ppc and i386 for 10.5
	  and 10.4, and on Linux (CentOS) and everything still seems to
	  work ok. Here are the changes I made (against OSG svn as of this
	  afternoon):
	  
	  - Added osgviewerCocoa example to APPLE builds
	  - Fixed corrupt Xcode project generation with CMake 2.6 dealing
	  with ADD_DEFINITIONS and CMake Policy CMP0005 on Leopard
	  - Resolved CMP0006 warning for examples and programs by setting
	  BUNDLE DESTINATION to same as RUNTIME DESTINATION with CMake 2.6
	  - Fixed freetype plugin on Leopard to avoid OpenGL linking
	  problem
	  - Figured out how to use a custom Info.plist included in the
	  project (see osgviewerCocoa application CMakeLists.txt)"

2008-06-23 08:06  shuber

	* From Stephan Huber: added missing config files and updated
	  xcode-project

2008-06-21 17:56  robert

	* Quietened down debug info

2008-06-21 17:50  robert

	* Added support for X11's overrideRedirect functionality

2008-06-21 11:34  robert

	* Converted tabs to four spaces

2008-06-20 19:52  robert

	* Changed the include/osg/Config and include/OpenThreads/Config
	  references to use the assocaited CMake variable for these headers

2008-06-20 19:51  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-20 17:32  robert

	* From Terry Welsh, added missing MixinVector header

2008-06-20 16:57  robert

	* Added OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM cmake option string to allow toggling
	  between X11 and Carbon under OSX.

2008-06-20 15:50  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, moved optional config variables into
	  include/osg/Config file that
	  is automatically created by cmake according to its own settings.

2008-06-20 15:49  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2008-06-20 15:28  robert

	* Changed const double* to const Matrix::value_type* to ensure
	  changes in Matrix type don't break the build

2008-06-20 13:16  robert

	* From Terry Welsh, new flatten static transforms visitor that
	  duplicates subgraphs that are shared beneath differnt static
	  transforms
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, made a range of changes to Terry's visitor
	  integrating it into osgUtil::Optimizer and
	  changing the code to use a style more like the rest of the OSG.

2008-06-20 11:16  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, made the include of bin directory for
	  include/OpenThreads/Config only used when doing out of source
	  builds

2008-06-20 11:11  robert

	* Updated version numbers for dev releases

2008-06-20 10:46  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Fixes a compile of
	  src/osgSim/ShapeAttribute.cpp on suse 10.2."

2008-06-20 09:46  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, fixed typo on variable name

2008-06-20 09:42  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, add search path to enable out of source
	  builds to find include/OpenThreads/Config.

2008-06-19 20:42  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-06-19 20:38  robert

	* From Neil Groves,
	  
	  "I have taken the liberty of updating a few files so that there
	  is no longer any derivation from std::vector. I have done this by
	  adding a new file osg/MixinVector and by updating only two
	  others: osg/PrimitiveSet and osg/Array. You will notice that this
	  actually removes what is acknowledged as a \u2018hack\u2019 in
	  osg/PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  With the original code I did manage to find memory leaks with
	  some compiler options on VC 8 and 9, as well as Intel compiler. I
	  determined the leak existence by instrumenting the destructor
	  code, and by use of a garbage collector as a leak detector (in a
	  similar manner to the Firefox project). Hence in contrast to what
	  I said originally, it is exhibiting symptoms on at least some
	  platforms.
	  
	  Since I am trying to be a good OSG citizen I got out my editor
	  and started hacking! I have built and tested on Linux (Ubuntu)
	  with GCC 4.x and Windows VC 8 SP1. It appears that nothing is
	  broken, and that I\u2019m using less memory J"

2008-06-19 17:35  robert

	* From Mathieu Marache, "submission for inclusion to support mpg
	  and avi files when using the quicktime plugin on windows"

2008-06-19 17:30  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, added support for using
	  OpenThreads::Atomic for thread safe ref/unref.

2008-06-19 14:57  robert

	* from Andrew Bettison, LineStipple support for .ive

2008-06-19 14:45  robert

	* From Adrian Egli, "Improvements to the PSSM implementation"

2008-06-19 14:35  robert

	* From Rudolf Weidemann, "in the OpenFlight format materials can
	  have editable names.
	  In the OSG OpenFlight plugin these names are ignored when
	  reading, and
	  empty strings are written.
	  
	  As we need these names in the OSG scene graph by our application,
	  I
	  changed the plugin code, so the names are now stored in class
	  "osg::Material" (derived from "osg::Object") by
	  material->setName();
	  (see "PaletteRecords.cpp, line 195) when reading the file, and
	  written
	  to file by
	  dos.writeString( m.Material->getName(), 12 );
	  (see MaterialPaletteManager.cpp, line 80).
	  
	  As these names otherwise get lost when reading an OpenFlight file
	  and
	  writing it again e.g. by
	  osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt
	  these changes make the plugin more complete.
	  
	  The changes were made to OSG revision 8425, and were tested by
	  osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt
	  comparing the material palettes of both files inside Multigen
	  Creator."

2008-06-19 14:29  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed some problems when setting up
	  CameraNodes that inherit
	  viewport settings in stereo mode. It seems that the
	  SceneView::cull()
	  method will pass the full size viewport to the left/right
	  cullvisitors, instead of the modified stereo viewport. I made
	  quite a
	  few changes to SceneView to fix the issue. The
	  SceneView::cullStage()
	  method will now receive the viewport as an argument, instead of
	  using
	  the global viewport. The SceneView::cull() method will pass the
	  modifed viewport to cullStage when rendering in stereo.
	  
	  There are 2 new private methods computeLeftEyeViewport() and
	  computeRightEyeViewport() that will compute the stereo viewports.
	  I
	  also modified the draw() function so it applies the correct
	  viewport
	  to the prerender stages. These changes are only necessary for
	  horizontal/vertical split stereo."

2008-06-19 14:14  robert

	* From Andrew Bettison, "Attached are changes for
	  src/osgPlugins/ive (version 2.4.0) that implement LineStipple

2008-06-19 13:49  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is a reworked version of the osgviewerWX
	  example. It changes the GraphicsWindowWX to only inherit from
	  osgViewer::GraphicsWindow and adds a standalone widget, called
	  OSGCanvas, that derives from wxGLCanvas. This solves a problem
	  with the GraphicsWindowWX instance being destructed twice (see
	  "Crash in osgviewerWX" of June 12th on osg-users). At program
	  exit, the main frame deletes all of its children widgets and
	  therefore calls GraphicsWindowWX's destructor, bypassing OSG's

	  waiting for them!

	* From Michael Platings, "On nvidia cards mipmap generation for
	  non-power-of-two textures with
	  GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS is very slow (over half a second for a
	  720*576
	  texture). However, glGenerateMipmapEXT() performs well (16ms for
	  the
	  same texture), so I have modified the attached files to use
	  Texture::generateMipmap() if glGenerateMipmapEXT is supported,
	  instead
	  of enabling & disabling GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS."
	  
	  Notes, from Robert Osfield, I've tested the out of the previous
	  path using
	  GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS and non power of two textures on NVidia
	  7800GT and
	  Nvidia linux drivers with the image size 720x576 and only get
	  compile times
	  of 56ms, so the above half second speed looks to be a driver bug.
	  With
	  Muchael's changes the cost goes done to less than 5ms, so it's
	  certainly
	  an effective change, even given that Michael's poor expereiences
	  with
	  GL_GENERATE_MIP_SGIS do look to be a driver bug.

2008-05-27 20:53  robert

	* From Brad Anderegg, "This submission fixes two bugs and helps
	  some performance problems we have been having with txp databases.
	  
	  
	  
	  The first bug is that the terrain tiles will page out to a lower
	  LOD when they are right in front of you. The issue appears to be
	  with the blacklisting heuristic which forces a tile to LOD 1,
	  commenting out the usage of blacklisting with the LOD Nodes fixes
	  our problem. This code change was made to line 29 of
	  TXPPageLOD.cpp.
	  
	  
	  
	  The second bug we were experiencing is that the database reader
	  options never make it through to the archive loader. The use case
	  for us appeared when the FID codes for the terrain were no longer
	  on the materials. As it turns out the archive was being created
	  twice, once by TXPNode and once by the ReaderWriterTXP on
	  getArchive() so the options never actually got set on the archive
	  that was being loaded. The fix is to first create the archive by
	  calling getArchive on the ReaderWriterTXP, which stores it in a
	  map for reference later, and then passing that archive into the
	  TXPNode for it to set its internal member. With this code change
	  we only create one archive (not sure what creating two did) and
	  our options flags get set properly on the database.
	  
	  
	  
	  The changes made are in TXPNode.h line 72 where the TXPArchive is
	  now passed in. In the TXPNode.cpp the loadArchive(TXPArchive*)
	  was changed to have the default behavior if NULL is passed in, if
	  an archive is passed in then it does not load it since all the
	  loading is done in the ReaderWriterTXP::getArchive(). The only
	  other place that loadArchive is called is in TXPIO.cpp where a
	  modification was made to pass in NULL which will have the same
	  behavior as it used to. The last change is the little block of
	  code starting on line 57 of ReaderWriterTXP.cpp, this was changed
	  so that it first calls getArchive() which caches the archives in
	  a map does some loading stuff and returns a pointer to it which
	  is then passed in as a parameter to TXPNode::loadArchive().
	  
	  
	  
	  The performance changes were made to TXPParser.cpp line 163 where
	  we use to osgUtil::Optimizer on the node before passing it off,
	  and on line 1456 we changed the geometry to use display lists.
	  These small changes actually made drastic performance increases
	  for us, as much as 1000% on certain laptops.
	  
	  
	  
	  As far as testing goes, we have tested these changes with at
	  least 5 txp databases on a variety of different computers
	  including Mac OS and Linux. The base version used is 2.4."

	* From Cedric Pinson, "By default it's the normal behaviour, it

	  both version without rebuilding everything ...

2008-05-27 13:11  robert

	* From John Vidar Larring, "Added vertical scale as a property of
	  osgTerrain::Terrain. Lets you configure vertical scale when
	  initializing the terrain model. E.g:
	  
	  osgTerrain::Terrain* terrain =
	  findTopMostNodeOfType<osgTerrain::Terrain>(model.get());

2008-05-27 12:07  robert

	* Updated version numbers in prep for 2.5.1 release

2008-05-27 12:06  robert

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've refactored the single
	  ReadedWriterVRML2.cpp into multiple files. The reason for doing
	  this was to break up the horribly long function
	  
	  osg::ref_ptr<osg::Node>
	  ReaderWriterVRML2::convertFromVRML(openvrml::node *obj)
	  
	  The fixes are:
	  
	  * Added the source's parent directory as search directory for
	  image files.
	  * The material properties are now set in the stateset of the
	  Geode rather than the Geometry. This will allow geometries to be
	  reused with different material properties in future updates.
	  
	  NB: I planned for a caching scheme in which multiple occurences
	  of the same primitive (e.g., Cylinders with radius 0.8 and height
	  1.2), would use the same Geometry object. Unfortunately, my
	  planning moved me to other areas, but I might still finish the
	  caching scheme in a quiet hour. For the time being I decided it
	  would be a good thing to already submit my current changes.
	  "

2008-05-27 11:13  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Included a fix for my past pbuffer
	  change. The version test fo 'need at least
	  glx 1.1' was broken, even if no implementation had yet a chance
	  to trigger
	  that :)
	  
	  Attached a fix for that broken test.
	  Based on rev 8358"

2008-05-27 11:07  robert

	* From Andrew Bettison, "Problem: the LineStipple pattern when read
	  from an OSG node file is always 0xFFFF, even though specified
	  otherwise in the OSG file.
	  
	  Cause: possibly a copy/paste typo in
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/LineStipple.cc, line 61:
	  if (fr[0].matchWord("functionMask") && fr[1].getUInt(mask))
	  
	  Solution: change to:
	  if (fr[0].matchWord("pattern") && fr[1].getUInt(mask))"

2008-05-27 11:04  robert

	* From Stephane Lamoliatte, "Here is a patch that fix the strange
	  bug describe on the osg-user group.
	  Finally it seems to not come from the empty geode. The origin of
	  the problem seems to be the uniform initialization during the
	  building of the program which call a glUseProgram.
	  If your scene never display the node that contains the shader and
	  if there is no other shader on the scene, this "glUseProgram" is
	  the only one that is called during your simulation. So, this
	  shader is applied on all the scene.
	  
	  I fix this bug by switching off the shader (by calling
	  glUseProgram(0) ) during the compilation of a state which does
	  not contain the shader.
	  "

2008-05-27 10:50  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "I have just done some changes on the classic
	  osgdb_gif plugin (based on OSG 2.5.0). I wish our developers may
	  use the newly written GIF reading plugin to attach animate GIF
	  files as textures now! In my opinion, a GIF is much smaller than
	  AVI and MOVs, and much more efficient sometimes.
	  
	  Changes includes:
	  1. A new GifImageStream class (inherit from osg::ImageStream and
	  OpenThreads::Thread) have already been added to implement
	  different operations of a GIF movie, such like playing, pausing,
	  rewinding, setting time and so on.
	  2. Some small changes to decode_row() and gif_read_stream(),
	  which make the transparency of GIF images correctly.
	  3. Just a few changes to the ReaderWriterGIF::readGIFStream()
	  function, which ensure that animate GIFs are loaded by
	  GifImageStream (and the function returns GifImageStream objects)
	  and static GIFs unchanged (still use the old method and returns
	  osg::Image objects!).
	  
	  Attachments are the cpp file and an animate GIF file for further
	  test. Just rebuild the osgdb_gif project and use osgviewer or
	  osgmovie to view it.
	  The plugin has been tested on Windows and Arch Linux."

2008-05-26 22:36  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, post 1:
	  
	  "Here is a collection of changes which should fix issues building
	  the OSG with CMake 2.6.0 (along with some other changes)
	  
	  CMakeLists.txt:
	  * Set CMP0003 to supress warning about linking against -lpthread
	  (which is a
	  non-absolute library location). (CMake 2.6.x fix)
	  * Modified the WIN32_USE_MP and a couple of other Visual Studio
	  specific flags
	  to be in an IF(MSVC) block (minor tweak to reduce exposing this
	  stuff on MinGW builds)
	  * Includes my second set of glu tesselator autodetection changes
	  that you
	  seemed to want but haven't committed yet.
	  
	  src/OpenThreads/pthreads/CMakeLists.txt:
	  * Eliminates warning when compiling on Linux about spaces in link
	  line (CMake 2.6.x fix)
	  
	  CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake:
	  * Tweaks to make the macros behave properly under CMake 2.6.0
	  (doesn't change behavior under CMake 2.4.x)
	  
	  CMakeModules/Find3rdPartyDependencies.cmake:
	  * Adds the NO_DEFAULT_PATH option to all of the search options so
	  that things in C:\Program Files\OpenSceneGraph aren't accidently
	  picked up during configure time and instead only things in the
	  "3rdParty" folder are discovered. (general bugfix)
	  "
	  
	  post 2:
	  "Ok, hold the presses. I just discovered that for some odd reason
	  the osgdb_* plugins under Linux aren't getting put under the
	  osgPlugins-2.5.0 folder. Not exactly sure why this broke, the
	  folder was there, just empty. I'll have to look into it this
	  evening."
	  
	  post 3:
	  
	  "Fixed, was caused by the switch to
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and some code in
	  osgPlugins/CMakeLists.txt that effectively overrides
	  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH on non-MSVC compilers to dump the plugins in
	  the plugins folder. I tweaked it to override
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY as well. Seems to work fine."

2008-05-26 22:34  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "When exporting a DrawArrays PrimitiveSet, the
	  DAE plugin computes an incorrect nbVerticesPerPoly if the first
	  index is not zero. The issue can be reproduced easily with:
	  osgconv cessna.osg cessna.dae
	  
	  Examination of the resulting .dae file reveals several
	  out-of-range tristrip indices; viewing the .dae file in osgviewer
	  causes a crash when OSG tries to lookup those indices.
	  
	  Attached resolves this issue."

2008-05-26 21:53  robert

	* From Art Tevs, "I've attached a patch for the Texture2DArray
	  which solves problems of loading image data into the texture
	  array. So here are a small description:
	  
	  - Solves issues of loading image data into the texture memory
	  - Print a warning if images are of different dimensions or have
	  different internal formats (GL specification requires images to
	  be the same)
	  
	  
	  Patch is tested and seems to work fine. It shouldn't break any
	  other functionality. It should go into include/osg and src/osg
	  "

2008-05-26 21:44  robert

	* Fixed copyright notice typo

2008-05-26 21:33  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The attached code changes StateSet::merge() so
	  that it copies RenderBin data such as the rendering hint and
	  RenderBin details from rhs into "this", only if "this" has
	  RenderBin mode set to INHERIT.
	  
	  It replaces a comment by you indicating something along these
	  lines should be done. To me, this seems like the right thing to
	  do."

2008-05-26 21:32  robert

	* From Gino, "According to the 1.4.1 COLLADA spec (2nd ed) the
	  standard behavior for fx_sampler_wrap_common is as follows
	  
	  CLAMP ->GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE
	  NONE->GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER
	  
	  The current 2.5.0 daePlugin assumes the following binding
	  
	  CLAMP ->GL_CLAMP
	  NONE->GL_REPEAT
	  
	  Notably the GL_CLAMP binding will result in visible black seams
	  on input files that use otherwise matching textures. Replacing
	  GL_CLAMP by GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE solves this problem. I've updated
	  both the read and write functions.
	  "

2008-05-26 21:18  robert

	* From Philip Lowman, "I changed the test name to be a little
	  easier to understand and defaulted Linux & Windows builds to
	  false and to skip the compile check as you desired.
	  "

2008-05-26 21:10  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-26 21:09  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is an update to the osgviewerWX example.
	  Keyboard events were not always received because the
	  GraphicsWindowWX wasn't receiving focus. It now receives focus
	  when the mouse enters the window.
	  * I split the mouse handling from a monolithic method to separate
	  ones, slightly cleaner than a whole bunch of if()'s, especially
	  with another case of the mouse entering the canvas.
	  * I changed the EVT_KEY_DOWN handler to an EVT_CHAR handler,
	  although that now makes the up and down handler assymetric. The
	  new down-handler returns translated key codes, so when you press
	  the S key (without anything else), it actually returns 's' and
	  not 'S' as the EVT_KEY_DOWN did. This means that statistics can
	  be called up in the viewer window, while the example previously
	  only printed a "Stats output:" line to the console. I'm not truly
	  happy that the up handler returns _untranslated_ key codes. But
	  solving this completely would probably mean adding some table
	  that translated from wxWidgets' untranslated key codes to OSG's
	  internal ones. This might be interesting to add, as anyone using
	  OSG + wxWidgets in any serious manner would also have to add
	  this.
	  * I commented out the evt.Skip()'s in the keyboard handlers as
	  these would only be necessary if there were some key events that
	  are not handled. But currently all key events are simply
	  forwarded.
	  * I changed the handling of a mouse drag to a more general mouse
	  move"

2008-05-26 21:04  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "I had to tighten a declaration in
	  OpenFlight/FltWriteResult.h, as the Solaris SunStudio 11 compiler
	  was being picky and wouldn't compile."

2008-05-26 20:46  robert

	* Added debug block to output the location of the master camera for
	  each View in a Viewer.

2008-05-26 17:30  robert

	* Added continuous recording of the animation path to the
	  RecordAnimationPathHandler

2008-05-26 16:25  robert

	* Introduce --pbuffer-only width height option, and added fps
	  reporting to stats output

2008-05-26 15:41  robert

	* Added basic --pbuffer width height support

2008-05-26 14:30  robert

	* Added better stats reporting

2008-05-26 12:01  robert

	* Added feedback of pixel format chosen for read back

2008-05-26 11:59  robert

	* Added automatic selection of the pixel type according to the
	  window type

2008-05-26 11:53  robert

	* Added option for doing triple buffering, and set the default read
	  format
	  to GL_RGBA

2008-05-25 22:06  robert

	* Switch to using an inital draw callback when use --start-frame

2008-05-25 21:52  robert

	* Added option for setting whether the front or back buffer should
	  be read using
	  --front and --back command line options.

2008-05-25 21:35  robert

	* Added option for controlling whether the front buffer is read at
	  the start of the
	  frame or the back buffer at the end of the frame.

2008-05-25 11:21  robert

	* Added check for pkg-config so that build only use related package
	  checks when
	  it's supported

2008-05-24 11:05  robert

	* Added #define's for PixelBufferObject extensions.
	  
	  Added docs for Camera::DrawCallback

2008-05-24 09:24  robert

	* Added RenderStage::setClear*() methods from Camera::getClear*()
	  sources

2008-05-24 08:13  robert

	* Changed default format to GL_BGR

2008-05-23 16:26  robert

	* Added single buffered and double buffered PBO support, and
	  --no-pbo,
	  --single-pbo and --double-pbo command line parameters

2008-05-22 17:50  robert

	* Added basic glReadPixels code

2008-05-22 15:43  robert

	* Added camera final callback attachment code.

2008-05-22 13:11  robert

	* Fixed name of source file

2008-05-22 13:10  robert

	* Added new osgscreencapture example folder, implementation to
	  follow

2008-05-22 12:38  robert

	* Reorginaized the DatabaseQueue's to avoid warnings under Windows

2008-05-22 11:21  robert

	* Fixed warning by adding in missing return

2008-05-22 08:31  robert

	* Checking in missed header

2008-05-21 21:09  robert

	* Refactored DatabasePager and related classes to introduce support
	  for
	  multi-threaded paging, where the Pager manages threads of reading
	  local
	  and http files via seperate threads. This makes it possible to
	  smoothly
	  browse large databases where parts of the data are locally cached
	  while
	  others are on a remote server. Previously with this type of
	  dataset
	  the pager would stall all paging while http requests were being
	  served,
	  even when parts of the models are still loadable virtue of being
	  in the
	  local cache.
	  
	  Also as part of the refactoring the DatabaseRequest are now
	  stored in the
	  ProxyNode/PagedLOD nodes to facilitate quite updating in the cull
	  traversal,
	  with the new code avoiding mutex locks and searches. Previous on
	  big
	  databases the overhead involved in make database requests could
	  accumulate
	  to a point where it'd cause the cull traversal to break frame.
	  The overhead
	  now is negligable.
	  
	  Finally OSG_FILE_CACHE support has been moved from the curl
	  plugin into
	  the DatabasePager. Eventually this functionality will be moved
	  out into
	  osgDB for more general usage.

2008-05-20 09:28  robert

	* Moved the compile to after the updateSceneView

2008-05-14 20:22  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-05-14 17:03  robert

	* Introduced preliminary support for asynchronous file read
	  requests,
	  
	  ReaderWriter::ReadResult now has a FILE_REQUEST enum.
	  ReaderWriter::Options now has a s/getAsynchronousFileReadHint()
	  parameter methods.
	  
	  libcurl based plugin now detects enabing of the
	  AsynchronousFileReadHint, but
	  as yet does not handle async requests - handling everything
	  syncronously.
	  
	  DatabasePager now by default will enable AsynchronousFileReadHint
	  for http
	  based file requests
	  

2008-05-14 14:59  robert

	* Moved the cache file writing into StreamObject so that the cache
	  file is only
	  created once data is being read.

2008-05-14 13:16  robert

	* Introduced a thread safe map which manages a single EasyCurl
	  object per thread.

2008-05-14 12:47  robert

	* Refactor curl usage so that a new EasyCurl class wraps up the
	  curl handle and
	  reading from curl.

2008-05-13 18:28  robert

	* Fixed lat/long ordering

2008-05-13 17:27  robert

	* Added support for -e level minX minY maxX maxY extents controls

2008-05-13 14:08  robert

	* Added --file-cache directoryname command line option support to
	  readNodeFiles(ArgumentParser&)
	  to make it easier to specify a local file cache, in place of the
	  default OSG_FILE_CACHE
	  env var.

2008-05-13 12:36  robert

	* Further work on computing of lat/long range of PagedLOD subgraphs

2008-05-13 10:56  robert

	* From Steven Thomas, "Subject: Collada fix
	  There was a problem converting a file to Collada by using osgconv
	  like this:
	  
	  osgconv file.osg file.dae

	  Error: daeLIBXMLPlugin::write(file://cessna.dae) failed
	  Warning: Error in writing to "cessna.dae".
	  
	  This was due to some bad URI processing code in the Collada
	  plugin. The attached file fixes this by using the Collada DOM's
	  URI processing functions. After this change the file will convert
	  successfully in the local directory.
	  "

2008-05-12 16:59  robert

	* Added signal handling code, and prelimary lat/long computation

2008-05-12 15:42  robert

	* Added missing getBound() method

2008-05-12 12:16  robert

	* Update ChangeLog and wrappers for 2.5.0 dev release

2008-05-12 12:16  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS for 2.5.0 release

2008-05-12 11:39  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, Fixed FrameBufferObject attachement code
	  to handle cases
	  where no texture or image is attached

2008-05-12 11:01  robert

	* Updated version number for 2.5.0 dev release

2008-05-12 10:55  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowski and Robert Osfield, moved command line
	  option usage setup
	  from osgviewer example into osg::ArgumentParser and
	  osgViewer::Viewer to make
	  them more universally available.

2008-05-12 10:18  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "* add easy multiple texture targets support for
	  obj by refactoring texture
	  load into it's own method.
	  
	  * use new method from step 1 to load 'map_opacity' textures from
	  .mtl files"

2008-05-12 10:16  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, fixed typo

2008-05-11 14:26  robert

	* Added CARIO_FOUND into svg plugins checks

2008-05-11 14:23  robert

	* From Miguel Escriva, Here you will find a SVG Image Reader. It
	  renders a SVG file as an osg::Image using cairo and rsvg.

2008-05-10 17:25  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "This change adds support for osg::Billboards to
	  the OpenFlight exporter.
	  
	  It might seem odd that the change actually removes the stub
	  apply(Billboard&) method, but it turns out Billboards are easily
	  supported in subordinate routines of the existing apply(Geode&)
	  method with s dynamic_cast, so there's no need for a separate
	  apply(Billboard&)."

2008-05-10 17:23  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Another round of plugin enhancements.
	  
	  3DC: Output now uses osg::notify.
	  JPEG: Now returns correct error code for empty input file.
	  FreeType: Prevent possible crash if Options is NULL."

2008-05-10 17:04  robert

	* Moved compile setup from osgViewer::ViewerBase into
	  osgViewer::Renderer to
	  avoid threading issues associated with compile running in a
	  parallel with
	  update/cull on the first frame.
	  
	  Also added automatic recompile when a new SceneData is applied to
	  a View.

2008-05-09 17:22  robert

	* Added --file-cache command line option to compliment -c

2008-05-09 17:08  robert

	* Initial cut of file cache population app

2008-05-09 11:54  robert

	* From Art Trevs, set the _geometryVerticesOut to default to 1 as a
	  workaround
	  for OpenGL driver bug that incorrectly reports a warning when
	  value is 0.

2008-05-09 11:27  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Attached are some minor plugin fixes. PNM, RGB,
	  and JPEG would all crash if attempting to read an empty file, and
	  FLT would go into an infinite loop. All are fixed with this
	  change.
	  
	  I also fixed some return values for a couple of these, changing
	  FILE_NOT_HANDLED to ERROR_IN_READING_FILE where appropriate."

2008-05-09 10:27  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, fixed window resize problem

2008-05-08 17:02  robert

	* Added missing check against handling invalid bounding sphere's

2008-05-08 16:48  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "I found one compilation error in OSG 2.4
	  in the Inventor plugin, where one node (SoTextureCoordinate3) was
	  assumed to be available in all versions of Inventor but is
	  actually only available in Coin. The use of the node is now
	  protected by #ifdef __COIN__ constructs. The attachment is based
	  on OSG 2.4, not SVN."

2008-05-08 16:45  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, "In KDE I switch desktops with Super-Tab,
	  and occasionally I
	  get an excess Tab key report when switching back to an OSG
	  application (usually FlightGear :-). Although KDE has consumed
	  the Tab, it's sometimes still in the XKeymapEvent's key_vector,
	  and followed by a Tab KeyRelease event.
	  
	  Avoid this artifact by
	  - asking for a "fresh" keymap (via XQueryKeymap()), rather than
	  using the unreliable(?) XKeymapEvent's key_vector, and by
	  - flushing all key events on focus-in (to avoid the KeyRelease)
	  
	  After Super-press, Tab-press, Super-release, Tab-release (note
	  the wrong release order!) I still get an extra Tab event. But
	  this is not surprising and not exactly wrong either. Also it's
	  hard to avoid, as we can't see what happened to the keyboard
	  before we regained focus.

	* From Jeremy Moles, osgviewerGTK example

2008-05-08 15:17  robert

	* From Sebastien Messerschmidt, "attached you'll find a patch for
	  the shp-plugin.
	  I've spotted huge memory leaks int ShapeParser and fixed them.
	  Also, there was a missing destructor (PolygonM) and a missing
	  member initialization (PolygonZ)
	  Would be nice if someone could test the changes.
	  
	  To release the memory just if no reading error happened (and
	  therefore the arrays would be valid) I've added an macro to
	  release and reset the pointers at once. I'm not using macros
	  myself very often as I don't like them, but I think it doesn't
	  hurt in this code.

2008-05-08 15:14  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and osgversion to catch Raymond de Vries name
	  correctly

2008-05-08 14:00  robert

	* From Raymond de Vries, "This fix tests the right variable before
	  it is allocated. Fortunately, until now it tested another
	  variable (_particleSizeUniform, which is, at that moment, not
	  allocated as well) and everything went ok. So it does not fix a
	  crash or so, it is a matter of correct code.
	  
	  Line 353 is changed from
	  
	  if (!_particleSizeUniform)
	  
	  to
	  
	  if (!_particleColorUniform)
	  "

2008-05-08 13:56  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "As I discovered prior to the 2.4 release, the
	  FLT export geometry backend was using some old turn-on code,
	  originally written just to enable other development but not
	  intended for actual release. Sadly, my OSG training commitments
	  prevented me from fixing this prior to 2.4.
	  
	  In essence, the FLT exporter was emitting a full set of Mesh
	  records each time it encountered a PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  Attached is a fix. The code now emits the Mesh set up records,
	  then iterates over all PrimitiveSets and emits a Mesh Primitive
	  record per PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  It also loops over PrimitiveSets twice, first writing Face
	  records according to the mode, the writing Mesh records (again
	  according to the mode).
	  
	  The final change included here is support for GL_POINTS as
	  single-vertex Face records.
	  
	  Billboards are still to come."

2008-04-18 11:09  robert

2008-04-17 15:30  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a refactored and
	  improved quicktime-plugin. I moved all code related to the
	  image-loading, swizzling etc into an extra class. The quicktime
	  plugin supports now reading and writing images from/to streams
	  and the code is less cluttered than previous versions.
	  
	  I removed QTtexture.h/.cpp and added QTImportExport.h/.cpp. I
	  updated the CMake-files, I hope they are alright. I used the
	  submitted code in my own apps since two months or so and it seems
	  pretty stable, but as always the migration to the osg-quicktime
	  plugin may have introduced new bugs, so perfect for developer
	  release :)"

	* From Bob Kuehne, "he attached are conversions of the 3 main
	  places i found in osg where tokens are used to represent bitmasks
	  with 'magic' numbers, like 32. i've changed these to a more
	  representative bitshift representation, showing clearly in which
	  bit you can expect this token to manifest. ie, converted things
	  like:
	  
	  from: DEEP_COPY_STATESETS = 8,
	  to: DEEP_COPY_STATESETS = 1<<3,
	  
	  showing clearly that this isn't the _value_ 8, but the _bit_ 8.
	  this is an old pattern i see (and like to promulgate) to make
	  code a bit more readable and maintainable.

	* From Art Trevs, moved multile render targets support from
	  RenderStage into FrameBufferObject.

2008-04-11 13:28  robert

	* From Philipp Machler, "We have extended the support for Wacom

	  Added usage example use OpenSceneGraph-Data/Images examples

2008-04-11 13:03  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "Here is a patch for cmakelists.txt to add
	  support for the /MP option
	  in Microsoft compilers as discussed in osg-users. There is now an
	  advanced option called WIN32_USE_MP (which defaults to OFF) that
	  will
	  enable the /MP switch for all builds. I tucked this code block
	  safely
	  within a IF(WIN32) branch."

2008-04-11 11:58  robert

	* From Jose Delport, a MRT example implementing stereo matching.

2008-04-11 11:19  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-04-11 11:10  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, "The GUIEventAdapter header file had
	  KeySymbols for the super and
	  hyper keys defined already, but these modifiers were missing in
	  GUIEventAdapter::ModKeyMask, and the EventQueue ingored them as
	  well.
	  
	  The attached diff/archive adds the missing parts for Super/Hyper
	  modifier key support.
	  
	  
	  I'm aware that this might not be supported on all
	  systems/keyboards
	  out of the box, but decided to submit it anyway because:
	  
	  - developers are aware of differences between input devices
	  (Some mice have scroll wheels, others don't. Some have five or
	  more buttons, some have only one. Some keyboards don't have
	  numpads, some have AltGr, some don't etc.)
	  
	  - even if someone relies on Hyper/Super in distributed software,
	  this is easy to fix and doesn't create lock-in conditions
	  
	  - while the names Hyper/Super may only be common on X11, they are
	  just symbol names and not OS-specific
	  
	  - even though some systems might not offer these additional
	  modifiers
	  by default, it's likely that all of them have at least 8 modifier
	  levels internally, so it should only be a matter of OS
	  configuration
	  to make them work
	  
	  - having super/hyper available is useful to offer a user ways
	  to define local key definitions that are safe from collisions
	  with
	  predefined "official" key assignments"

2008-04-11 10:58  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "Modified the cmakelists.txt file for the
	  curl plugin so the proper
	  linker directories are set in Win32. The old cmakelists.txt would
	  set
	  the lib release folder for debug builds as well. This should
	  correct
	  that."

2008-04-11 10:31  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, fixed typo.

2008-04-11 10:30  robert

	* From Benoit Laniel, "I use mingw to cross-compile openscenegraph
	  to win32. However, linux
	  filesystem is case-sensitive. Here are the modifications needed
	  to make
	  the compiler happy. These are only some include lines rewritten
	  (Io.h to
	  io.h, Windows.h to windows.h etc.) for version 2.3.7."

2008-04-11 10:16  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "1) add simplifier command "--simplifier .5" to
	  reduce complexity
	  2) complementarily add a "--overallNormal" to replace
	  per-vert/per-facet normals with an overall. simplifier doesn't
	  work
	  in certain cases without less complex normals. this gets that
	  done.
	  3) add env var output with full verbose output so people realize
	  it's
	  active when the app is run - i see this all the time in training
	  where
	  people run osgconv, with unintended data transformations due to
	  osgUtil:;Optimzer, for example"

2008-04-11 10:10  robert

	* Added --mouse option to enable mouse tracking, and fixed bug in
	  assumption
	  that nv is not null.

2008-04-03 18:36  robert

	* Introduced CMake build option for compiling double or float
	  versions of osg::BoundingSphere and osg::BoundingBox.
	  
	  Introduced code in BoundgingSphere, BoundingBox, ProxyNode and
	  LOD to utilise the above settings.
	  
	  Added Matrix::value_type, Plane::value_type,
	  BoundingSphere::value_type and BoundingBox::value_type command
	  line
	  options that report where the types of floats or doubles.

2008-04-03 18:06  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "The X11WindowingSystemInterface in
	  osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp
	  unconditionally sets the X11 error handler routine, replacing
	  anything
	  that was previously set. This is a bit unfriendly, as the X11
	  error
	  handler is a global attribute which the application, or the GUI
	  toolkit
	  being used, may well have set itself.
	  
	  So I have modified X11WindowingSystemInterface to only replace
	  the error
	  handler if it is the default i.e. if the application has not set
	  it."

2008-04-03 10:26  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "While using the dds plugin (via osgdem) it
	  was able to write 24bit
	  images with BGR order but not read them. My 2-liner fixed it for
	  me
	  but it may be that someone with more knowledge of the plugin want
	  to
	  insert more pixel formats in the reading part of the plugin."

2008-04-02 17:08  robert

	* From Jose Delport, added support for MRT via glDrawBuffers

2008-04-02 13:57  robert

	* From Mattias Helsing, "Subject: osga reading slash mismatch
	  requests for files in a archive are made with unix style paths.
	  So to
	  be able to match an entry in map(_indexMap) it's keys needs to be
	  stored in unix style even on Win32"
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfied, simplified this submission so that the
	  added conversion to
	  unix slahes is done on all platforms as this should be safe and
	  simpler to maintain.

2008-04-02 13:55  robert

	* Updated to reflect new COLOR_BUFFER0 value

2008-04-02 13:48  robert

	* From Jose Delport, introduced osgmultiplerendertargets example

2008-04-02 13:47  robert

	* Changed the Camera::BufferComponent::COLOR_BUFFER0 from being
	  equal to COLOR_BUFFER
	  to being COLOR_BUFFER+1 to enable differentation between non MRT
	  and MRT paths.

2008-04-02 11:28  robert

	* From Jose Delport, typo fixes

2008-04-01 17:22  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog, osgversion and AUTHOR.txt for 2.3.7 dev
	  release

2008-04-01 14:52  robert

	* Removed svn:externals property

2008-04-01 14:28  robert

	* Updated data for 2.3.7 dev release

2008-04-01 11:03  robert

	* Updated OpenThreads version to 2.2.1 with the switch of
	  sources/svn:externals from OpenThreads to OpenSceneGraph.

2008-04-01 10:49  robert

	* Moved OpenThreads directly into OpenSceneGraph/trunk rather than
	  being introduced via svn:externals.
	  
	  This change has been done to make it easier for OpenSceneGraph
	  users to check out the svn via https
	  without any conflicts introduced with a http externals.

2008-04-01 10:33  robert

	* Updated version numbers for 2.3.7 dev release

2008-04-01 10:11  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Two changes:
	  - Handle DrawArrays first/count correctly (fixes problem reported
	  by Jason Daly)
	  - Display warning if non-Geometry Drawable is encountered."

2008-04-01 10:00  robert

	* From Tatsuhiro Nishioka and Stephan Huber, bug fixes and
	  enhancement of cursor suppoort.

2008-03-31 16:23  robert

	* Added checks for a valid scene graph before doing various ops on
	  it.

2008-03-31 14:00  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, build fix for Solaris

2008-03-31 11:44  robert

	* Added Camera::s/getClearAccum, s/getClearStencil and
	  s/getClearDepth.

2008-03-31 09:43  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-29 09:59  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox with a little reorganisation from Robert
	  Osfield, added
	  test for 0 sized subloads, ignoring them to prevent a divide by
	  zero error occuring on some buggy drivers.

2008-03-28 19:56  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Some small changes and code cleanup. Biggest
	  change is an improvement to the WriteResult return."

2008-03-28 18:42  robert

	* Set Texture::setMaxAnisotropy() to 16.0f for better quality
	  terrain when looking at shallow angle.

2008-03-28 17:53  robert

	* Improved the error capture and reporting

2008-03-28 15:52  robert

	* Rewrote the DatabasePager::removeExpiredSubgraphs(double) routine
	  as it
	  as not expiring subgraphs quick enough to enable reasonable load
	  balancing.
	  
	  New version isn't perfect and will need further work, but does at
	  least reduce
	  the memory footprint by as much as half on test paths on big
	  databases.
	  
	  The rewritten method no longer uses the the
	  MaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs
	  and MinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs variables so these and
	  associated methods
	  for accessing them have been removed.
	  
	  - /** Set the maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per
	  frame */
	  - void setMaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs(unsigned int number)
	  { _maximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs = number; }
	  -
	  - /** Get the maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per
	  frame */
	  - unsigned int getMaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs() const {
	  return _maximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs; }
	  -
	  - /** Set the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD child to keep
	  */
	  - void setMinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs(unsigned int number) {
	  _minimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs = number; }
	  -
	  - /** Get the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD child to keep
	  */
	  - unsigned int getMinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs() const { return
	  _minimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs; }

2008-03-28 15:31  robert

	* Introduced mutex into Terrain node to manage the tile system data
	  structures

2008-03-28 15:28  robert

	* Reordered set up of scene and event handlers to prevent warning

2008-03-28 13:22  robert

	* Removed old lower case versions

2008-03-28 12:44  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Here's the mods to the OpenFlight plugin to
	  support FLT export. The ZIP file contains the new .cpp/h files as
	  well as existing files that I modified.
	  
	  Changes to existing files:
	  ReaderWriter.cpp -- to support writeNode() of course.
	  ReaderWriterATTR.cpp -- to support writeObject -- we write .attr
	  files for textures, if they don't already exist.
	  AttrData.cpp/.h -- Minor fixes.
	  CMakeLists.txt -- to include the new files in the build."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, port to non Windows platforms just required
	  fixing of header capitilization errors
	  that windows lets through the net due to having a case
	  insensitive file system.
	  

2008-03-27 13:21  robert

	* Removed TileSystem class, and added support for TerrainTile's
	  automatically
	  registering and unregistering themseles with the enclosing
	  Terrain node.

2008-03-27 11:56  robert

	* Added wrapper for TerrainTile

2008-03-27 11:55  robert

	* Renamed osgTerrain::TerrainSystem to osgTerrain::Terrain

2008-03-27 10:55  robert

	* Renamed Terrain to TerrainTile

2008-03-26 20:06  robert

	* Introduce TerrainSystem node which decorates a complete terrain
	  model made up of Terrain tiles.

2008-03-26 20:03  robert

	* From Carlo Camporesi, "I have made some changes in order to allow
	  the using of proxies via env variables and options.
	  I have modified also the cmakelist. In this way osg is able to
	  find the library in 3rdParty directory."

2008-03-26 20:01  robert

	* From Carlo Comporesi, adding support of finding libcurl in 3rd
	  party dependencies

2008-03-25 15:21  robert

	* From Tomas Hnilica, "
	  Attached is modified source of AdapterWidget.cpp file from
	  osgviewerQT
	  example. Original was token today from SVN - trunk. (2.3.6).
	  --mdi option needs to be set to run MDI version.
	  
	  Few notes:
	  - tested on Windows box (Win XP)
	  - using QT4
	  - I was not able to execute the example with QOSGWidget - had
	  same
	  error like described in [osg-users] "fate error using QOSGWidget
	  in
	  develop release
	  2.3.0" thread from Shuxing Xiao, 2008-01-08.
	  - problems are described in source
	  
	  --
	  
	  And Later post:
	  
	  The problem of keypress events was solved by QT community,
	  attached is
	  repaired AdapterWidget.cpp file.
	  In the AdapterWidget class constructor following line was added:
	  setFocusPolicy(Qt::ClickFocus);
	  Scene disappearing by resizing to minimum still needs to be
	  fixed..."

2008-03-25 13:14  robert

	* Moved include of c headers to top, and remove using std::strlen
	  in an attempt to solve gcc4.3 compile problems

2008-03-25 13:06  robert

	* Added limits.h to try and avoid gcc 4.3 compile problems

2008-03-25 13:01  robert

	* Added #include<memory> to fix gcc 4.3 build problem

2008-03-25 12:26  robert

	* Fixed LessGeode operator.

2008-03-25 11:50  robert

	* From Wojciech Leandowski, "I removed few lines of code that were
	  setting Threading mode and Screen mode. I believe they are now
	  not neccessary because the same does osgViewer::Viewer argument
	  parser. In fact argument list does not contain these args after
	  they were parsed by osgViewer::Viewer constructor.
	  
	  I also allowed myself to add ThreadingHandler to the example."

2008-03-24 18:06  robert

	* Added sampling down to 32x32 mesh for 64x64 height fields as a
	  workaround to
	  memory consumption issues with high res whole earth paged
	  databases.

2008-03-24 18:03  robert

	* Added mutex to prevent multiple cull threads changing the
	  MultiTextureControl at one time.

2008-03-24 10:53  robert

	* Added full range of cameras manipulators to
	  osgmultitexturecontrol example

2008-03-23 18:28  robert

	* Added < and > key bindings to allow the speed to be animation
	  speed to be increased or decreased.

2008-03-21 18:35  robert

	* Added preliminary file cache support. Enabled by setting the
	  OSG_FILE_CACHE variable.

2008-03-21 18:31  robert

	* Added missing break; at end of each case entry.

2008-03-21 15:43  robert

	* Fixed push/popping of filepath, removed verbose debug messages

2008-03-21 13:20  robert

	* Added better detection and error reporting of files without
	  proper server address

2008-03-21 13:08  robert

	* Added initial cut of libcurl based plugin

2008-03-20 10:24  robert

	* Updated date for 2.4.6 release

2008-03-19 21:05  robert

	* From Melchoir Franz, "osgViewer toggled the NumLock state
	  correctly when pressing the NumLock
	  key, but it didn't pick up the initial state. So, if NumLock was
	  on for
	  the OS at startup (LED on), it was still off for OSG. And the
	  first
	  keypress turned the LED off, and NumLock on for OSG. The attached
	  fix
	  picks up the state on every FocusIn, just like it was done in the
	  last
	  commits for CapsLock. The difference is, that the NumLock mask
	  isn't
	  standardized (e.g. 0x10 for Linux, and 0x80 for AIX), so we have
	  to do
	  a reverse lookup (::rescanModifierMapping()).
	  
	  Note that I could not reproduce the problem on my system, but
	  someone
	  else confirmed it twice on his, and the patch fixed it for him.
	  
	  Changed files:
	  ./include/osgViewer/api/X11/GraphicsWindowX11
	  ./src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp
	  
	  "

2008-03-19 17:11  robert

	* Update AUTHOR file

2008-03-19 17:10  robert

	* Updated version and ChangeLog for 2.3.6 dev release.

2008-03-19 12:30  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-19 12:09  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschimdt, Added polygon offset controls

2008-03-19 11:41  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-19 11:41  robert

	* Revert the Camera::setInheritanceMask(0x) calls that were added
	  as workaround to a bug introduced by a bug fix to the way the
	  inhertiance mask was handled in CullVisito::apply(Camera&)

2008-03-19 11:40  robert

	* Introduced InheritanceMaskActionOnAttributeSetting member to
	  CullSettings, and associated applyMaskAction method that is
	  now used in all CullSettings::set*() methods, which by default
	  helps disable the inheritance mask associated
	  with settings that are made locally.

2008-03-18 17:44  robert

	* Set the CullSettings::InhertianceMask to 0x0 as temporary measure
	  till we
	  work out the best scheme to use w.r.t inhertiance of CullSettins.

2008-03-18 15:48  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-18 15:37  robert

	* To osg::AutoTransform added support for MinimumScale,
	  MaximumScale and AutoScaleTransitionWidth parameters
	  and a new scheme for computing the scaling when using autoscale
	  that introduces smooth
	  transitions to the scaling of the subgraph so that it looks more
	  natural.

2008-03-18 10:45  robert

	* Added example code showing how to set the minimum and maximum
	  scales

2008-03-18 09:17  robert

	* Added ObjectRecordData to include list

2008-03-17 15:22  robert

	* Added minimum and maximum scale support to osg::AutoTransform

2008-03-17 12:23  robert

	* Fixed moving model bug where the moving model code was looking
	  for a transform with DataVariance set to DYNAMIC, but the scene
	  graph set up code was leaving the setting to default to STATIC.
	  Fix involved setting DataVariance on moving transoforms to
	  DYNAMIC.

2008-03-17 12:13  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-17 12:11  robert

	* Added doxygen docs

2008-03-17 12:09  robert

	* Introduce
	  osgParticle::ParticleSystem::s/getParticleScaleReferenceFrame()
	  to
	  help manage the scaling of particles, whether they should be
	  relative to the
	  local coordiante frame of the particle system, or be in world
	  coordinates.

2008-03-17 10:29  robert

	* Added fire effect, enabled by --fire command line option. The new
	  fire effect
	  has been introduced to reproduce the scaling of paricle effects

2008-03-15 19:27  robert

	* Added better error reporting

2008-03-14 16:51  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "typo fix : NVidea -> NVidia (including option
	  --Nvidea)"

2008-03-14 16:24  robert

	* Update ChangeLog and AUTHORS.txt file for 2.3.5 release

2008-03-14 15:33  robert

2008-03-14 15:33  robert

	* Added utilty script for cleaning up build files/directories.

2008-03-14 15:32  robert

	* Fixed indenting

2008-03-14 15:13  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, "Attached is a fix for remaining problems in
	  capslock handling:
	  It sets osgGA's keymask when restoring keys on FocusIn, according
	  to the state values of XKeyEvent and XCrossingEvent. (These are
	  the only source for X11's current capslock state that avoids
	  pulling in the XKB extension.)
	  "

2008-03-14 15:00  robert

	* Missing checkin

2008-03-14 14:35  robert

	* Added iostream include

2008-03-14 13:21  robert

	* Added cloning of the StateSet before modification to work around
	  threading issue
	  relating to the StateSet being modified by the event/update
	  thread and read from
	  the draw thread at the same time.

2008-03-14 12:03  robert

	* Converted static const unsigned int definitio to enum.

2008-03-14 11:53  robert

	* Updated version/author type fixes, authors, readme and changelog
	  for 2.3.5 dev release

2008-03-14 11:06  robert

	* Improved the indenting

2008-03-14 11:06  robert

	* Changed the const get(), operator*() and operator->() methods to
	  return non const T versions

2008-03-14 11:01  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, build fix for Solaris

2008-03-13 19:48  robert

	* Fixed doc comment

2008-03-13 19:44  robert

	* Removed gl and glu prefixes from SceneGraphBuilder methods to
	  avoid problems under Solaris

2008-03-13 16:40  robert

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've added a few fixes to the VRML 2.0
	  plugin:
	  
	  1) Full DOS paths are now correctly opened by OpenVRML. A URL
	  containing
	  a DOS path should be "file:///C:data/blah" rather than
	  "file://C:data/blah".
	  
	  2) The last primitive defined in "coordIndex" is now added if the
	  "coordIndex" is not terminated by -1.
	  
	  3) Smoothed normals are computed if no normal field is provided.
	  Currently, there is no support for "creaseAngle", so all edges
	  (even the
	  ones sharper than the creaseAngle) are smoothed. I might add this
	  in the
	  future if demand rises.
	  
	  4) If an IndexedFaceSet contains only triangles or quads then the
	  primitive type is set to TRIANGLES or QUADS, and the primset
	  becomes
	  DrawArrays rather than DrawArrayLengths.
	  
	  Question: I noticed that for DrawArrays you can still provide an
	  index
	  array. Would the rendering be faster if I'd create DrawElements
	  primsets
	  rather than DrawArrays? Phrased differently, what is the benefit
	  of
	  using DrawElements over DrawArrays, as there is clearly not a
	  one-to-one
	  mapping of these concepts to their OpenGL counterparts?
	  
	  5) Objects are added to the transparent bin and blend mode is
	  enabled
	  only if the transparency is nonzero. Rendered transparent objects
	  no
	  longer write the depth buffer."

2008-03-13 16:38  robert

	* From Jose Delport, "attached is a version of osgunittests that
	  does not give false alarms
	  for the case where q1 = -q2. The output of 'osgunittests quat' is
	  now
	  much cleaner.
	  "

2008-03-13 16:22  robert

	* From Paul Melis, "Here is an updated osgviewerWX example to bring
	  it more in line with the
	  other GUI toolkit examples. It now takes a model file as
	  command-line
	  argument (complaining if there isn't one), and its startup window
	  size
	  is now actually applied (it used to be too small). I tested this
	  with a
	  unicode-build of wxWidgets, as that is the recommended build type
	  on
	  Linux with GTK. I'm pretty sure this version of the example will
	  work
	  for the ANSI build as well, but I have no way of testing."

2008-03-13 16:18  robert

	* From Melchoir Franz, "ac3d.cpp does currently strip everything
	  but the file name in
	  "texture" paths. This is to drop absolute paths that some
	  3d editors export (even AC3D itself!). But this also strips
	  directories of relative paths, which is wrong and contradicts
	  the ac3d reference implementation. (The reference implementation
	  doesn't strip anything, though, and so takes the absolute paths
	  as they are. Definitely not what we want.)
	  
	  The attached solution checks absolute paths and only strips
	  those:
	  
	  (1) A:\\foo\\bar.png -> bar.png (as before)
	  (2) /foo/bar.png -> bar.png (as before)
	  
	  (3) foo/bar.png -> foo/bar.png (new)
	  (4) ../foo/bar.png -> ../foo/bar.png (new)
	  
	  "

2008-03-13 16:12  robert

	* From Melchoir Franz, Caps lock support under X11

2008-03-13 16:05  robert

	* Added double versions of intersect methods

2008-03-13 16:05  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2008-03-13 15:23  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, "I've taken this another step, to use
	  value_type inside the intersect calls. I did choose to use sqrt()
	  instead of sqrtf()."

2008-03-13 15:21  robert

	* From Paul Martz, files for adding ObjectRecordData support into
	  OpenFlight

2008-03-13 14:09  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The attached preserves OpenFlight Object record
	  data as UserData in the osg::Group corresponding to the Object
	  record.
	  
	  The files are:
	  include/osgSim/ObjectRecordData -- The new class. Derives from
	  Object to support .osg IO.
	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PrimaryRecords.cpp -- Reads data into
	  that class.
	  src/osgPlugins/osgSim/IO_ObjectRecordData.cpp -- .osg IO
	  support."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, made the OpenFlight read object record data
	  optional via the -O readObjectRecordData ReaderWriter option.

2008-03-13 13:44  robert

	* Added support for assigning state to created drawables,
	  implemented gluDisk.

2008-03-13 13:43  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "Here I send minor corrections to the text
	  output by the osgforest example when
	  building its graphs. The message "Creating billboard based
	  forest" appears
	  four times regardless of the actual type of the graph being
	  built.

2008-03-11 13:23  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "it appears to me that sun CC cannot use
	  static functions from template
	  functions. The attached change is required to make it compile
	  with sun CC."

2008-03-11 13:19  robert

2008-03-05 11:52  robert

	* From Atr Trevs, added missinging initializers

2008-03-05 11:33  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I changed osgGA::StateSetManipulator
	  to mirror the
	  osgViewer::StatsHandler and other handlers which allow you to
	  change the
	  key(s) you would press to get them to do something. Pretty simple
	  change
	  but useful in our context and possibly in others too."

2008-03-04 17:57  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "
	  The problem can be reproduced by simply changing the osgpick
	  example to
	  use a CompositeViewer with a single view initialized using
	  setUpViewAcrossAllScreens(). I have attached a modified
	  osgpick.cpp so
	  you can test it out quickly (please don't check this file in
	  though :-)
	  ) The eventState is then incorrect and picking does not work. The
	  only
	  changes are in CompositeViewer.cpp (eventTraversal() method), and
	  fix
	  the problem for me.

2008-03-04 16:39  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Attached is an updated to
	  osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32.
	  
	  The win32 pbuffer implementation returned an error unless both
	  the
	  WGL_ARB_pbuffer and the WGL_ARB_render_texture functions were
	  present.
	  This was too restrictive, as a pbuffer can usefully be created
	  without
	  render-to-texture, e.g. for use with glReadPixels. The osg
	  1.2/Producer
	  pbuffers worked without RTT, and osgUtil::RenderStage has all the
	  code to
	  handle both RTT and non-RTT pbuffers, doing a read and copy in
	  the
	  latter case.
	  
	  With these changes I have successfully tested the osgprerender
	  example
	  on a graphics card which supports RTT, and one which doesn't.
	  Plus
	  tested in my own application.
	  
	  In order to aid diagnostics I have also added more function
	  status
	  return checks, and associated error messages. I have included the
	  win32
	  error text in all error messages output. And there were some
	  errors
	  with multi-threaded handling of "bind to texture" and a temporary
	  window
	  context which I have corrected.
	  
	  These is one (pre-existing) problem with multi-threaded use of
	  pbuffers
	  in osgViewer & osgprerender, which I have not been able to fix. A
	  win32
	  device context (HDC) can only be destroyed from the thread that
	  created
	  it. The pbuffers for pre-render cameras are created in
	  osgUtil::RenderStage::runCameraSetUp, from the draw thread. But
	  closeImplementation is normally invoked from the destructor in
	  the main
	  application thread. With the additional error messages I have
	  added,
	  osgprerender will now output a couple of warnings from
	  osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32::closeImplementation() at exit, after
	  running multi-threaded on windows. I think that is a good thing,
	  to
	  highlight the problem. I looked into fixing it in
	  osgViewer::Renderer &
	  osgUtil::RenderStage, but it was too involved for me. My own
	  application requirements are only single-threaded.
	  
	  Unrelated fix - an uninitialised variable in
	  osg::GraphicsThread::FlushDeletedGLObjectsOperation().
	  "

2008-03-04 16:22  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Attached is modified
	  osgShadow::ShadowMap. I changed following things:
	  
	  1:
	  Shadow map camera sets ABSOLUTE_RF_INHERIT_VIEWPOINT refernce
	  frame.
	  
	  2:
	  Light Direction by matrix multiplications replaced with
	  transform3x3 multiplication.
	  
	  3:
	  I made DebugingHUD functional by adding special draw callback.
	  Former version was simply drawing pale square.
	  
	  4:
	  I was tempted to make 4 th change but decided to not do it.
	  Instead I put it whith #if VIEW_DEPNDENT_TEXGEN. If you decide
	  you may let it go.
	  
	  When objects are not centered at 0,0,0 coord but in some distant
	  location (for example at surface of earth ellipsoid) shadow
	  texgen suffers from inadequate precision of float matrices. I
	  changed that by premultiplying Texgen matrix (using OSG double
	  matrices) with inverse modelview and applying it later with
	  ModelView identity matrix. This tweak may be appropriate for
	  OverlayNode texgen as well.
	  
	  I left former version because I suspect that this change will
	  make osgShadow::ShadowMap view dependant. Currently texgen matrix
	  remains the same no matter what View displays it. With my change
	  it wuld be different for each view. This touches the subject of
	  View Dependent Shadow Techniques that J-S asked recently."

2008-03-04 16:03  robert

	* Refactored the way that the camera settings are inhertied

2008-03-04 15:29  robert

	* From Art Trevs, "in the current implementation of the
	  FrameBufferObject
	  there is a bug. The header file do specify something
	  like this:
	  
	  FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D* target, int zoffset,
	  int level = 0);
	  
	  However in the .cpp file we have:
	  
	  FrameBufferAttachment::FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D*
	  target, int level, int zoffset)
	  
	  
	  Which means that the meaning of level and zoffset is

2008-03-04 15:10  robert

	  Windows 2000 function GetLongPathName() is called."

2008-03-04 14:19  robert

	* Change the setViewAsLookAt method to use Vec3d rather than Vec3
	  for better precision

2008-03-04 11:52  robert

	* Changed the updateStateSet code so that it creates a new StateSet
	  each update
	  rather than clear and reuse the existing one, this change fixes a
	  threading

2008-02-27 11:46  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Per the discussion in osg-users, this change

2008-02-27 11:43  robert

	* From Paul Martz, fixed get/set methods API

2008-02-25 17:30  robert

	* From Melchior Franz, fixed handling of modified keys when
	  entering/leaving window

2008-02-25 16:50  robert

	* From Franz Melchior, "When switching virtual desktops or
	  minimizing a window, keys
	  remain in pressed state after revealing, even if they are no
	  longer pressed on the keyboard. This can have bad effects,
	  especially if the stuck keys are modifier keys. One has to
	  press and release the stuck keys again to reset the wrong state.
	  
	  The fix keeps track of all key presses and releases. On FocusOut
	  and UnmapNotify it releases all keys that are in pressed state,
	  and on KeymapNotify (following a FocusIn), it sets the currently
	  pressed keys again. To avoid confusion in the OSG-using
	  application
	  normal keys are always reported released /before/ and pressed
	  /after/ modifier keys.
	  
	  As current key states are returned as char[32] keymap by
	  XQueryKeymap and XKeymapEvent, this format is also used to
	  recognize modifier keys and for maintaining the current
	  internal key state. Functions to set/clear/query bits in
	  such a keymap are added.
	  
	  The patch was extensively tested with osgkeyboard and
	  FlightGear under KDE and fvwm2. It was not tested on a
	  Xinerama setup or with multiple windows, but as _eventDisplay
	  is used throughout, there should be no problems. The patch also
	  makes the following changes:
	  
	  - removes old and obsolete handling of modifier keys in
	  ::adaptKey().
	  This wasn't only unused, but also wrong (and for that reason
	  commented
	  out in revision 7066). The modifier states are actually handled
	  in ./src/osgGA/EventQueue.cpp (EventQueue::keyPress/keyRelease).
	  - fixes some spelling"

2008-02-25 16:26  robert

	* From Emmanuel Roche, "I'm joining two zip files to this mail for
	  the modified sources and include files of osgIntrospection.
	  
	  The modifications I made are very small but they are absolutely
	  usefull to use osgIntrospection with visual studio 7.1 or 8 in
	  debug modes.
	  This should also solve other minor common problems (converter
	  memory leak, virtual destructor for PropertyInfo, etc...).
	  
	  I choosed two function names : Reflection::uninitialize() and
	  Type::reset(), this can of course be changed if someone has a
	  better idea...
	  
	  I made the changes against OSG 2.2.0 public release. I tested the
	  result with VS 7.1, VS 7.1 SP1, VS 8.0 SP1 and AQTime 5.0 on
	  Windows XP SP2... All 4 seem to agree : they detected memory
	  leaks before and don't anymore.
	  
	  Sorry I haven't take the time to test that on linux but the
	  changes are so small I doubt there could be a problem... I let
	  you check that on your side :-).
	  
	  I hope this will help making OSG an even more wonderfull
	  library."

2008-02-25 16:05  robert

2008-02-25 14:27  robert

	* Changed method parameter to use const &

2008-02-25 14:15  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "----1----
	  
	  Attached is a fixed version of OverlayNode.cpp. I fixed
	  CustomPolytope::cut( osg::Plane ) method. Bug was apparent in
	  such scenario:
	  
	  Let P1 be some random frustum polytope
	  Let P2 be the polytope that was created from P1 bounding box (P2
	  contains P1 entirely)
	  
	  Then ignoring precision errors: P1.cut( P2 ) == P2.cut( P1 ) ==
	  P1. But this condition was not always met. Cut failed when some
	  of the polytope reference points happened to lie exactly on some
	  intersecting planes in both P1 & P2 (plane distance was = 0).
	  
	  I only use CustomPolytope for my shadowing stuff so I did not
	  test how this affects rest of OverlayNode.cpp.
	  
	  ----2----
	  
	  Also attached is a minor precision improvement for osg::Plane
	  intersect method (double version).
	  
	  ----3----
	  
	  I have also one observation regarding osg::Plane - There are two
	  intersect vertices methods (float and double flavour):
	  
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3>& vertices) const
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3d>& vertices) const
	  
	  I guess osg::Plane won't compile when someone changes default
	  vec3 typedef to vec3d. Shouldn't the first method be changed to
	  use vec3f explicitly ? Ie:
	  
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3f>& vertices) const"

2008-02-25 13:25  robert

	* From Glenn Waldron, "As you may recall, we discussed adding

	  the code is identical though. Note that the DDS plugin already
	  contained the readObject() implementations."

2008-02-25 13:17  robert

	* From Wojciech Lawandowski, "Fixed
	  EllipsoidModel::computeLocalUpVector to use Vec3d instead of Vec3

	* From Rene Molenaar, "Using commandline build system nmake on

	  This is caused by the OSG_MSVC_VERSIONED_DLL hack.
	  there are hard-coded paths to place the dll's in the bin /dir
	  that normally would go
	  in the lib/config (release/debug) dirs. Nmake has different
	  locations for the files (no config dir).
	  
	  fix: change the macro's in OsgMacroUtils.cmake for the IF(NOT
	  MSVC_IDE) situation.
	  Libs go in lib/, and DLLs and executables go in bin/
	  To accopmplish this for MSVC_IDE the targets get a "../../bin"
	  prefix,
	  for nmake this should be "../bin" (because there are no config
	  folders).
	  
	  This fix mimics the behaviour of the MSCV_IDE (visual studio)
	  build system when building with nmake.
	  
	  Note:
	  A change in the main CMakeLists.txt creates the needed plugin

	* From Glen Waldon, "This change patches ReaderWriterOSGA.cpp so
	  that it passes along the ReaderWriter::Options to files loaded

2008-01-21 14:42  robert

	* From Drederic Bouvier, "I noticed the AC3D loader resets database
	  path given as Options,
	  preventing users to put textures in another directory. This patch
	  adds
	  the model path to the path list instead of replacing it."

2008-01-21 14:41  robert

	* Introduced BUILD_REFERENCE_DOCS option to make it a bit clearer

	  to test it
	  osgviewerd -e ogr file.tab
	  or
	  osgviewerd -e ogr file.gml

	* From Paul Martz, Hi Robert -- "as you and J-S and I have been
	  discussing on osg-users, this submission changes the clamp mode
	  for the fake white texture applied to non-textured geometry.

2008-01-14 11:30  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Multi-texturing fails with recent osg on
	  older graphics cards, due to
	  use of parameter GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS which is
	  only part
	  of the standard from 2.0 onwards. I've updated src/osg/State.cpp,
	  so
	  that it attempts to be more rigorous regarding OpenGL version and
	  extension checking."

2008-01-14 11:22  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog, date and version number for 2.6.2 release

	* Updated wrappers

2008-01-14 10:14  robert

	* From Daniel Stien, "When removing a child from a osg::Group,
	  childRemoved is called after the
	  node has already been erased from the node list, causing
	  childRemoved to be
	  performed on the consecutive node.
	  
	  Lines 180 and 182 are swapped in the attached Group.cpp.
	  "

2008-01-11 12:16  robert

	  target building will work now.

	* Added support for MinLevel and MaxLevel for ProxyLayer

2008-01-08 13:24  robert

	* Introduced new osg::discardDeletedOpenGLObjects() methods, and
	  usage of it in
	  GrpahicsContext::close() to handle cases where
	  deletingOpenGLObjects is no possible,
	  such as when GraphicsWindowEmbedded is used.

2008-01-08 13:22  robert

	* Removed debug info

2008-01-08 13:10  robert

2008-01-04 20:03  robert

	* Fixed date

2008-01-04 20:00  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "Attached are a few Find modules with updates.
	  Among other things, they
	  contain better support for environmental variables to pre-empt
	  the
	  autodection default search path order which is very helpful for
	  people
	  who do automated builds. (I recommend that the remaining modules
	  consider adding the same system to make things consistent and
	  easier
	  for those people that want to do the automated builds.)
	  
	  The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH has also been added to help people. I don't
	  recommend adding this to the other modules because it looks like
	  CMake
	  agreed with my idea and will be adding the support in 2.6. So
	  when
	  that ships, people will get it for free. (In the meantime, my
	  modules
	  that do have it, it can be used.)
	  
	  Finally, I've submitted all of these modules to official CMake
	  plus
	  more so they will be in the next version of CMake. It looks like
	  I may
	  need to sort some compatibility issues out with the KDE people
	  who
	  seem to have conflicting modules, but this is unrelated to the
	  updates
	  submitted here as OSG already has these conflicts. I figured I
	  would
	  just sync OSG up with my current/best versions.
	  
	  Also of note, I added the large batch of Findosg*.cmake modules
	  to
	  CMake so people building against OpenSceneGraph can use these
	  without
	  writing their own. I wasn't sure if I should submit them here or
	  not
	  since they are for building against OSG and not for building OSG
	  itself. So they are not included.
	  "

2008-01-04 15:33  robert

	* From Glenn Waldron, "I found that
	  osg::Sequence::setDuration(speed,reps) was not changing the
	  animation speed factor as expected. The one-line fix (line 312)
	  is attached"

2008-01-04 15:30  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Correction to size of reserved filed in .attr

	  OcclusionQueryNode

2007-12-26 22:00  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The osgocclusionquery example contained some
	  duplicate code that was also in the core OSG occlusion query
	  code. This change removes the need for that."

2007-12-26 21:43  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-26 21:39  robert

	* From Sid Byce, fixes for compiling with gcc 4.3

2007-12-24 14:47  robert

	* From Rafa Gaitan, "I have corrected some includes of the
	  quicktime plugin
	  from Quicktime/Quicktime.h to QuickTime/QuickTime.h.
	  MacOsX filesystem is normally case insensitive, but in
	  my case I changed that option and the quicktime headers
	  were not found. Now compiles fine and on case insesitive
	  file systems should work correctly too. "

2007-12-24 14:45  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "I'm still having a problem with SWING
	  animations on sequences. Here's
	  the fix again, merged with this morning's svn (including the
	  other
	  Sequence fixes from J-S)."

2007-12-24 12:56  robert

	* Based on Suggestions from "Harald A" fixed CMake setup of Doxygen
	  docs

2007-12-23 18:15  robert

	  size as state that
	  is passed into the getGlyph and getKerning methods rather than a
	  current state of the font itself.

2007-12-23 13:45  robert

	* Moved Font code across to using FontSizePair internally and on
	  Font methods, but
	  still using original implemetations.

2007-12-23 13:18  robert

	* Renamed osgText::Font::SizePair to osgText::FontSizePair in prep
	  for use this more

	  Added support for inserting loading models into --mt
	  multithreaded implementation.

	* From Paul Martz, Introduced osg::OcclusionQueryNode with support
	  for OpenGL occlusion query extension

2007-12-21 14:21  robert

	* From Bryan Thrall, "UFOManipulator ignores any attached
	  CoordinateFrameCallback; the
	  attached files fix this (based on 2.2 release).
	  "

2007-12-21 14:16  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Something to extend the texture
	  subloading blacklist.

	* From John Kelso,"Attached is the ive reader/writer for the 2.x
	  version of the osg::Sequence

2007-12-21 13:32  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, "Here is a implementation of
	  setScreeResolution and
	  setScreenRefreshRate for systems support Xrandr. The include
	  CMakeFile
	  makes this optional, and turns it OFF by default, in which case
	  any
	  person trying to use these functions under Linux will be
	  instructed to
	  build osgViewer w/ Xrandr support.
	  "

2007-12-21 13:31  robert

	* Added return

2007-12-21 13:18  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When using osg::Sequence you can stop
	  the sequence by setting the mode
	  to STOP. Subsequently, you can restart it from the beginning by
	  setting the mode to START. This does not work as expected. The
	  _now
	  time is not updated while the mode is STOP, which causes the
	  items in
	  the sequence to flash by very quickly when the mode is set to
	  START.
	  
	  For example, if the mode was set to STOP and left that way for 30
	  seconds, and there are 10 items in the sequence, when the mode is
	  set
	  to START all the items will flash by (in 3 loops) while the _now
	  time
	  catches up with the real time, and then the sequence will go on
	  at the
	  rate it should.
	  
	  This is a simple fix for that, which updates the _now time
	  regardless
	  of the mode the sequence is in."

2007-12-21 13:07  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "By complete coincidence I just have
	  read an old OSG submission mail related
	  to bugfixes in osg::Polytope.setToUnitFrustum and
	  setToBoundingBox It was
	  sent at beginning of december. I read it when purging my Thrash
	  emails and
	  found it there this because it was wrongly classified as SPAM.
	  
	  What stroke me in this email was the fact that there was once an
	  error in
	  Polytope class. Since I adopted CustomPolytope (osgSim
	  OverlayNode.cpp) for
	  my minimal shadow area computations I checked my code for this
	  error. And I
	  found it in CustomPolytope::setToUnitFrustum method.
	  CustomPolytope::setToBoundingBox seemed OK.
	  
	  So I went back to the origin and fixed this error in
	  OverlayNode.cpp as
	  well. I have not tested it in OverlayNode though (I don't know
	  how) so
	  please look at this carefully. But it seems to work fine with my
	  shadow
	  calculations."

	* From Wojiech Leandowski, "I earlier wrote about my hassles with
	  archives under Windows. I implemented
	  64 bit binary compatible OSGA archive reader/writer using mixed
	  stdio/iostream calls. But during this work I learned that it can
	  be made in
	  much simpler way.
	  
	  Attached is result of this new attempt. I hope its appropriate
	  for inclusion
	  into OSG codebase. It was compiled and tested with latest SVN
	  OSG, Windows
	  XP 32 bit and Windows Vista business 64 bit. OSG was built using
	  VS 2005
	  Express SP1 for 32 bit environment and VS 2005 Std for 64 bit.
	  ---
	  Solution description (there were two problems involved):
	  ---
	  Problem 1: implicit conversions beetween file positions and 32
	  bit int. This
	  could be considered a MS compiler bug because this 32 bit int was
	  additionally implicitly converted to/from 64 bit. As far as I
	  know compiler
	  is allowed to make only one implict conversion (but maybe this
	  rule does not
	  refer to simple types).
	  
	  Its actually possible to address OSGA files above 4 GiB range
	  using 32 bit
	  windows iostreams. MS Iostreams in practice offer the same level
	  of
	  functionality as stdio functions. There are functions fsetpos and
	  fgetpos in
	  stdio lib which use 64 bit file pointers (fpos_t). These
	  functions are
	  internally called by seekp( streampos ), seekg( streampos ),
	  tellp(), and
	  tellg() methods. So its also possible to change and retrieve file
	  postions
	  using iostream calls. But the problem lies in implicit handling
	  of streampos
	  type.
	  
	  streampos type is actually a template class used as seekp, seekg
	  parameter
	  and returnd from tellp, tellg. Its capable of storing 64 bit file
	  pointers.
	  But streampos can be also converted to/from simple type
	  streamoff. It has
	  proper constructor and cast operator. In Win 32 environment
	  streamoff is
	  defined as long (~32 bit int). So when seekp, and tellp arent
	  used with
	  exact streampos objects but OSGA_Archive::pos_type complier makes
	  implicit
	  casts to 32 bit int types loosing important bits of information.
	  
	  So above problem could be easily handled by making conversion
	  calls
	  explicit. My code defines 2 functions used to convert back and
	  forth beetwen
	  64 bit OSGA_Archive::pos_type and std::streampos objects:
	  
	  OSGA_Archive::pos_type ARCHIVE_POS( const std::streampos & pos );
	  std::streampos STREAM_POS( OSGA_Archive::pos_type & pos );
	  
	  Rest of the OSGA implementation code was modified to call these
	  conversions
	  explicitly with seekp, seekg, tellp, tellg.
	  
	  ---
	  Problem 2: seekp and seekg have two variants. Only one of these
	  variants is
	  actually 64 bit proof.
	  
	  When I solved my first problem and made use of explicit streampos
	  conversion
	  functions, OSGA archive was able to read my example 11 GiB
	  archive. But
	  there were still problems with write and append. I found that the
	  reason for
	  this was pair of seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ) and tellp()
	  calls. It turned
	  out that use of seekp, seekg( offset, direction ) function
	  variants was
	  setting file pos pointer to EOF when file was larger than 4GiB.
	  But I
	  noticed that one arg seekp, seekg ( streampos ) versions worked
	  correctly.
	  So the solution was to change OSGA write logic a little, and
	  replace
	  seekp( offset, direction ) with seekp( absolute_pos ) calls.
	  I achieved this by modifing IndexBlock write method to record and
	  restore
	  file pos after IndexBlock was written. This modification has the
	  effect that
	  put pointer is generally kept at the end of file, so there is no
	  need to
	  repostion to the end before writing the files. This allowed me to
	  get rid of
	  those problematic seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ) calls.
	  
	  There was one place where I could not easily get rid of seekp( 0,
	  std::ios_base::end ). It was situation where existing OSGA was
	  opened for
	  appending. I resolved this by computing file length by finding
	  max position
	  from index block and file block endings. Then I replaced former
	  seekp( 0,
	  std::ios_base::end ) with seekp( STREAM_POS( found_file_length ).
	  ---
	  
	  Description of these changes may sound bit hacky but in practice
	  these were
	  fairly simple and straightforward modifications. I hope they pass
	  your
	  review. There is one complex preprocessor condition which I based
	  on few
	  lines taken from boost positioning.hpp. Boost licence does allow
	  such
	  reproduction. In case of problems this condition may be easily
	  simplified to
	  windows only implementation.

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Some clients at my new job noticed
	  that picking did not work with the
	  osg::Capsule subclass of osg::Shape in an osg::ShapeDrawable.
	  Other
	  shapes worked fine. So I have fixed this. Code attached.
	  
	  My modification is in the PrimitiveShapeVisitor, and is based on
	  the
	  DrawShapeVisitor - I added methods called createCylinderBody and
	  createHalfSphere, and used them in apply(Cylinder&) and
	  apply(Capsule&). In my testing they work fine, tested even with
	  transforms and moving around the scene.

2007-12-16 17:53  robert

	* Added check to make set up a sequencegroup only happen when
	  required.

2007-12-16 17:46  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "osgSim::BlinkSequence has
	  sequenceGroup unitialized by default (=NULL ref_ptr). By looking
	  at the code I figured out that unset sequenceGroup is completely
	  correct and thus allowed.
	  
	  But writing BlinkSequence with empty sequence group caused a
	  crash when IVE was accessing baseTime from NULL address.
	  
	  Atttached is a fix for this situation.

2007-12-16 17:41  robert

	* From Wojiech Lewandowski, "There was a bug in ShadowMap camera
	  view matrix computation. View matrix was wrong when light was
	  directional and shadowed scene was not centered at zero coord. I
	  fixed that and also modified cast distance to much smaller value.
	  With former range it was possible to generate shadows with lowest
	  LODs. "

2007-12-15 15:17  robert

	* Tweaked the abmient lighting contribution so that the OpenGL

	  option (OSG_MSVC_GENERATE_PLUGINS_AND_WRAPPERS_MANIFESTS) to
	  specify if we want to generate or not the manifest files under

	* From Mike Garrity, "There was an on again/off again thread on OSG
	  users about
	  creating subclasses of osg::Array that referenced data
	  stored an application's internal data structures. I took
	  a stab at implementing that and ran into a couple of
	  downcasts in Geometry.cpp. Enclosed is my take at fixing
	  those along with a simple example of how to do this."

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a change to the PBuffer
	  initialsation code that checks for the GLX
	  version before issuing commands that require GLX-1.3.
	  
	  This prevents a crash with open source drivers on linux.
	  "

2007-12-11 14:06  robert

	* From Roger James, "The changes are as follows:-
	  
	  1. DAE object no longer held onto by plugin.
	  2. Filename to URI conversion now handled internally by plugin.
	  2. User can supply an external DAE object for use by the plugin.
	  3. User can supply a std:string object for the plugin to return
	  the URI of
	  the document just processed.
	  4. User can supply a std::string to receive the unit name
	  information from
	  the document just read in. (e.g. meters, inches, etc.)
	  5. User can supply a float to receive the metric conversion
	  factor from the
	  document just read in.
	  6. User can supply an enum to receive the up axis orientation
	  information
	  from the document just read in.
	  7. Material transparency can be both read and written.
	  8. User can supply an experimental GoogleMode option on output.
	  The plugin
	  will try to emulate the way Sketchup specifies transparency (i.e.
	  the
	  inverse of what it should be!). I am still struggling to get GE
	  to
	  understand transparency, anyone know what it expects?
	  9. Rudimentary support for Collada effect parameters (newparam,
	  setparam,
	  param) on input. Basic nVidia FX Composer dae documents can now
	  be read.

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-11 12:32  robert

	* From Tim More, "This submission tries to optimize redundant
	  compilation of StateSets and Drawables
	  in the DatabasePager. The practical effects of these are to
	  greatly reduce startup time
	  and the time to load an individual scenery tile in FlightGear.
	  
	  - From my log message:
	  
	  Minimize the number of StateSets and drawables that are compiled
	  by checking
	  if they have already been compiled or will be elminated by the
	  SharedStateManager.
	  
	  Move the sorting of the dataToCompile queue out of
	  compileGLObjects
	  into the man pager run function.
	  
	  Change the SharedStateManager to use maps instead of vectors."
	  

2007-12-11 11:57  robert

	* From Joseph Steel, "he change is to initializeExtensionProcs() to
	  verify the version of the OpenGL implementation before attempting
	  to get the
	  MaxTextureCoords parameter."

2007-12-11 11:55  robert

	* From Mathias Froelich, "I have cleaned up the state set handling
	  of the osg::ClipNode.
	  Previously the complete StateSet was cleared, even the non
	  clipping releted
	  state attributes and modes in this stateset on a call to
	  setLocalSetateSetModes.
	  With this change only those modes/attributes are changed that
	  need to be
	  changed. That is, if a clip plane is removed from the ClipNode,
	  only this
	  assiciated mode is removed from the state set, instead of
	  throwing away the
	  whole state set.
	  
	  In this way we have less surprising results if the state set of a
	  clip node is
	  used for more state than just the clip state.
	  "

2007-12-11 11:42  robert

	* From Mathias Froechlich, "I have extended the StateSet api with a
	  
	  StateSet::removeAssociatedModes(const StateAttribute*)
	  
	  and a
	  
	  StateSet::removeAssociatedTextureModes(unsigned, const
	  StateAttribute*)
	  
	  call. These funktions are just missing for a complete api IMO."

2007-12-11 11:37  robert

	* From Alberto Luaces, "it seems that include/osgParticle/BoxPlacer
	  was created from the SectorPlacer
	  file. The code works well but the SectorPlacer comments stayed in
	  the new
	  file. I have altered those comments so they now contain valid
	  information for
	  the BoxPlacer class and the doxygen generated documentation is

2007-12-11 11:21  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix allowing removal of shaders

	  after the
	  program is first compiled."

2007-12-10 20:56  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "In ESRIShapeParser.cpp, wasn't closing the
	  file handle. Added:

	  to the constructor."

2007-12-10 20:36  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "For osgviewerCocoa, a very simple change to
	  allow toggling between
	  fullscreen mode and back between views. (To activate, double
	  click on
	  the view to toggle.) It demonstrates/uses the new one-liner
	  fullscreen
	  method introduced in Leopard. Code will still compile and run in
	  pre-Leopard (thanks to Obj-C dynamic/late binding), but code path

	  -- illum==0 -> no osg::Material created/attached therefore no
	  lighting
	  -- illum==1 -> osg::Material specular is set to black
	  -- illum==2 (default) -> specular read from .mtl file is used

	  osgViewer.

2007-12-10 15:15  robert

	* From David Callu, added support of 3D text to osgText and
	  associated plugins.

2007-12-10 12:45  robert

2007-12-09 16:38  robert

	* From Gustavo Wagner, fixed bugs in reading M records from
	  shapefile

2007-12-09 16:29  robert

	* From Gino van den Bergen, "I've added the following features to
	  the OSG VRML plugin:
	  * Support for Box, Sphere, Cone, and Cylinder. These nodes are
	  converted
	  to osg::Geometry conform the VRML97 spec.
	  * Backface culling is enabled/disabled according to the "solid"
	  flag for
	  geometries that are converted from IndexFaceSets.
	  * PROTO instances can now be used for "appearance" and "geometry"
	  fields
	  in a Shape node.
	  
	  The file ReaderWriterVRML2.cpp is adapted for the latest stable
	  public
	  release:
	  
	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/svn/osg/OpenSceneGraph/tags/OpenSceneGraph-2.2.0
	  
	  The changes where needed for being able to read VRML file which
	  are
	  output by VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). A sample
	  VRML file
	  is enclosed in this submission.
	  
	  The plugin has been tested against a number of VRML samples that
	  include
	  texturing. The texturing is found to be VRML97 compliant for all
	  added
	  geometry nodes.
	  "

2007-12-09 16:23  robert

	* Removed redundent OpenFlightOptimizer

2007-12-09 16:14  robert

	* From Ralf Karn, fixed "invalid enumerant" warning on
	  TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY_EXT initialization

2007-12-09 16:06  robert

	* From Mihai Radu, "After someone asked for a fix for non-textured
	  object appearing black
	  with the shader for textured objects. This works very well in
	  cases
	  where there could be a mix of textured and non-textured objects
	  in the
	  scene, and it makes the initialization more robust.
	  The idea is from PSSM, to add a 1pixel texture to the main
	  rendering as
	  to provide white for any objects missing textures."

2007-12-09 16:01  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-09 15:43  robert

	* From David Callu, added DBase attribute support for shapefiles

2007-12-09 14:54  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-12-09 12:19  robert

	* From Aderian Egli, changed the window dimension clamping code to
	  work independantly for width and height.

2007-12-08 17:10  robert

	* From Mario Guimaraes, "Currently, in the StateSet::merge method,
	  the rhs state attributes and
	  modes are not merged into the lhs state when the rhs is
	  PROTECTED. The
	  changes I'm providing here address this problem."

2007-12-08 17:04  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Hi Robert,
	  
	  You were right about the CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS option for
	  CMake, so here is a modification allowing to not generate the
	  manifest files for the plugins making them a lot more easy to
	  redistribute. I have also made the same modification to the
	  wrappers as they are also put into the osgPlugin folder when
	  generated.
	  "

2007-12-08 17:00  robert

	* from Paul Matz, "Understood. Well, I think it's reasonable to
	  assume that the non-env var
	  case is the more tested case, and therefore it is correct to set
	  _supportsVertexBufferObjects to the same value as _fastPath. So
	  here's a
	  change that does the same thing for the env var case."

2007-12-08 16:52  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, Anders Backman and Robert Osfield,
	  
	  both Jeremy and Anders added static build support as an option,
	  but one was
	  for Unix and one for Windowsm, but the two mods were also
	  inconsitent in naming
	  and implementation. I have had a bash at merging them both, but
	  don't know yet
	  if these changes will work yet on either configuration... user
	  testing will tell...

2007-12-08 16:37  robert

	* From Peter Hrenka, "Due to popular demand I would like to submit
	  this
	  enhanced version of PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  
	  New features of PolytopeIntersector :
	  
	  * Dimension mask: The user may specify the dimensions of the
	  primitives to be tested. Checking polytope-triangle and
	  polytope-quad intersections is rather slow so this can
	  be turned off.
	  * Reference plane: The resulting intersections are sorted
	  by the distance to this plane.
	  
	  New memebers of PolytopeIntersector::Intersection :
	  
	  * distance: Distance of localIntersectionPoint to the reference
	  plane
	  * maxDistance: Maximum distance of all intersectionPoints to the
	  reference plane.
	  * intersectionPoints: The points intersecting the planes of the
	  polytope
	  or points completely inside the polytope.
	  * localIntersectionPoint: arithmetic mean of all intersection
	  points
	  * primitiveIndex: Index of the primitive that intersected
	  
	  
	  I added some more output to the example osgkeyboardmouse."

2007-12-08 15:46  robert

	* From David Cullu and Robert Osfield, David addded a new style of
	  OSG integration with QT by sublcassing from QTWidget and using
	  osgViewer to create the graphics context, Robert added
	  integration of this codes
	  with the original AdapterWidget implementation still available by
	  default. The new implementation can be accessed by running:
	  
	  osgviewerQT cow.osg --QOSGWidget
	  

2007-12-08 15:32  robert

	* From Daniel Larimer, "There was a error with QTUtils.h when
	  compiling on HFS case-sensitive
	  file system. The #include<Quicktime/Quicktime.h> line needs to be
	  replaced with #include<QuickTime/QuickTime.h"

2007-12-08 15:27  robert

	* From Neil Hughes, "Please find attached a replacement for the 3DS
	  pluggin's ReaderWriter3DS.cpp file. This contains a minor fix
	  (one line added) to ensure that the OSG Material structure is
	  given the name of the material definition within a loaded 3DS
	  file.
	  "

2007-12-08 15:08  robert

	* From Donald Cipperly, Fixed memory leak in computeIntersections

2007-12-08 15:04  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, "This extra call to SDL_VideoSetMode()
	  prevents my viewport from getting
	  all wonky when I resize the SDL window. I'm not sure if this bug
	  has
	  always existed or not, but according to the SDL documentation
	  this
	  operation should be safe regardless, and doesn't not introduce
	  the need
	  for extra memory management (that is: there is no need to
	  "cleanup" the
	  old screen variable, that is all handled by SDL for us).
	  "

2007-12-08 13:29  robert

	* From Robert Osfield and Richard Schmidt, made fixes inspired by
	  an original submission from Richard which
	  highlighted problems with Light, ClipPlane and Hint usage in
	  osg::State's usage of cloneType
	  and reassignment of target/num in StateSet/these StateAttributes.

2007-12-08 12:12  robert

	* From David Callu, added IO_FluidProgram implementation.

2007-12-07 13:42  robert

	* Added an #include<assert.h> to avoid compile problems on some
	  systems.

2007-12-07 13:28  robert

	* From Tony Horrobin, "Attached is a small fix for the openflight
	  loader with regard to road
	  segment and construction records.
	  
	  It just uses the id field to set the name of the osg node as with
	  other
	  types."

2007-12-07 13:19  robert

	* From Paul Martz, minor typo fixes in notify messages

2007-12-06 17:53  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, added extra event handlers

2007-12-06 17:44  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The bmp writer crashes in certain cases.
	  It happens when the computed
	  size of the image data is greater than the actual image size.
	  This
	  causes the memcpy call to go out of the array bounds. I modified
	  the
	  code so that it copies the data during the iteration, instead of
	  memcpy'ing. This fixes the problems i was having.
	  
	  If you are curious, the writer was crashing when trying to write
	  an
	  RGB image that was 2050 x 1280. You might be able to reproduce it
	  by
	  allocating an empty image of that size and writing it to a file."

2007-12-06 17:41  robert

	* From Hautio Jari, "Current version of GraphicsWindowWin32 allows
	  resize to zero height
	  window. This breaks rendering in for example MFC SDI applications
	  and in
	  MFC MDI applications if user resizes the window so that client
	  area has
	  zero height. Current safeguard for minimized window:
	  
	  LRESULT GraphicsWindowWin32::handleNativeWindowingEvent( HWND
	  hwnd, UINT
	  uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam )
	  ...
	  /////////////////
	  case WM_MOVE :
	  case WM_SIZE :
	  /////////////////
	  ...
	  if (clientRect.bottom==0 && clientRect.right==0)
	  ...
	  
	  does not cover this situation. In these situations
	  clientRect.bottom = 0
	  and clientRect.right > 0.
	  
	  Quick fix to this is relax condition:
	  if (clientRect.bottom==0 || clientRect.right==0)
	  
	  Modified file is attached.
	  
	  Tested with osgviewerMFC from 2.2.0 release (Windows XP sp2)
	  
	  Before fix:
	  - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg.
	  - the cow is rendered nicely.
	  - resize window to zero height by dragging from bottom border
	  upwards.
	  - resize window back to original height
	  - just blue screen, no cow
	  
	  After fix:
	  - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg.
	  - the cow is rendered nicely.
	  - resize window to zero height by dragging from bottom border
	  upwards.
	  - resize window back to original height
	  - the cow is where it is supposed to be.
	  "

2007-12-06 17:31  robert

	* From Serge Lages, "Here are some modifications to the
	  DatabasePager, with the possibility to :
	  
	  - Get or set the target number of PagedLOD children to remove per
	  frame.
	  - Get or set the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD to keep.
	  
	  Corresponding environment variables have been added too.
	  The default values reproduce the previous DatabasePager
	  behavior."

2007-12-06 17:28  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, fixes for toggle fullscreen on gnome desktop

2007-12-06 17:07  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Add missing includes. Fails on hp-ux."

2007-12-06 17:01  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Attached is a changed version of
	  osgunittests.cpp. The __FUNCTION__
	  macro/string value is not portable. Instead the functions name is
	  just put
	  into the string."

2007-12-06 16:50  robert

	* From Wojiech Leandowski, fixed the hardwiring of archive
	  extensions to 4 charaters

2007-12-06 10:04  robert

	* Fixed crash in cfg by rearranging the code blocks so the codes
	  that use the graphics context are only called when a graphics
	  context is successfully aquired.

2007-12-06 09:22  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, added osgViewer dependency for OSX build

2007-12-05 18:32  robert

	* Changed WIN32 guard to _WIN32_IMPLEMENTATION to attempt to avoid
	  Win32 build error

2007-12-05 11:29  robert

	* Removed debugging line.

2007-12-05 11:23  robert

	* From Cedric Pinson, first cut at Producer .cfg camera
	  configuration file support.

2007-12-04 14:46  robert

	* Added support for new double Vec*Array classes in various
	  functors.

2007-12-04 14:46  robert

	* Added optional double support via new Vec3dArray support in
	  osg::Geometry.
	  
	  To enable double usage set the option string "double" i.e.
	  
	  osgviewer myshapefile.shf -O "double"
	  

2007-12-04 14:44  robert

	* Added support for double Vec*Array objects

2007-12-04 14:44  robert

	* Added missing files for qt plugin

2007-11-09 20:04  ewing

	* For osgdb_freetype:
	  Ugh. Another fix for the cycle problem. It seems that the SDKROOT
	  didn't necessarily solve the problem, but there were some
	  unneeded library dependencies that weren't in my test fork which
	  allowed my test to work, but caused SVN to fail.
	  I have removed some of the excess libraries and it seems to build
	  without the Q&A fix.

2007-11-09 13:16  ewing

	* OpenThreads Version header was mistakenly in Resources.
	  
	  osg Texture2DArray header was mistakenly in Resources.

	* From Colin Dunlop, add live video stream support

2007-11-04 16:08  robert

	* Added support for setting volume in xine plugin, manual
	  adjustment of volume

2007-10-31 12:55  robert

	* Added getColor method to allow easy reading of individual pixels.

2007-10-31 11:06  robert

	* Fixed wrap mode for panoramic display.

2007-10-17 19:01  robert

	* Removed redundent X11/Intrinsic include

2007-10-16 19:04  robert

	  Minor fixes to readme.

2007-10-05 10:46  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "since we patched our hp to an other

2007-10-04 10:05  robert

	* Updated version for 2.2 release

2007-10-04 08:54  robert

2007-10-03 23:27  robert

	* Updated version for 2.1.15 dev release

2007-10-03 23:03  robert

	* From Panagiotis Papadakos, "Setting the maximum height of osgText
	  doen't seem to work. If the text is
	  big enough, it exceeds the height that I gave as input to
	  setMaximumHeight. So check if cursor is out of -_maximumHeight."

2007-10-03 23:01  robert

	* Added support for defining an option
	  OSG_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT within the
	  CMake build system, enabling this option will build the OSG
	  against the (...) version
	  of the tesselation callback functions.
	  
	  One can also set the default value of this option via the
	  DEFAULT_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT
	  variable that is set locally to OFF for all platforms except AIX
	  and OSX, but can
	  be overriden by setting it via command line option i.e.
	  
	  cmake . -DDDEFAULT_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT=ON
	  

2007-10-03 21:12  shuber

	* updated XCode projects

2007-10-03 20:21  robert

	* Added GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT path into include/osg/GLU and
	  enabled this
	  for AIX as reading the old paths this was required. This looks
	  like it is needed
	  under Xcode build as well.

2007-10-03 19:54  robert

	* Removed double return error

2007-10-03 12:49  robert

	* Refactored the plugin and library naming to fix Cygwin plugin
	  loaded issues.

2007-10-03 10:38  robert

	* Added return 0 to fix warning

2007-10-02 21:45  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-10-02 21:45  robert

	* From Mihair Radu, "Most of the additions are small utility
	  methods:
	  - set the resolution of the shadow map; it calls dirty() to
	  re-initialize at next update
	  - keep a list of Shader objects to use instead of the default
	  ones, if
	  the list is empty, the default shaders are used
	  - explicitly create the Uniform variables, so that subsequent
	  additions
	  that require more Uniforms can put them in a central place
	  - set a Light or LightSource to use explicitly for shadow
	  casting,
	  allows multiple lights in the scene, with one casting shadows
	  
	  There are two additions that do not ( yet ) function correctly,
	  but in
	  the present usage they do not interfere with the regular usage of
	  the
	  techique:
	  - support for using spotlights, it's using Light.spotCutoff to
	  determine
	  if it's a spot-light and not point-light,
	  there is an error in the setup of either the shadow camera or the
	  texgen, most likely due to the direction of the spotlight, since
	  the
	  position is being used just like in point or directional lights.
	  - creation of a debugHUD
	  the hud is created properly, ( the example included shows it ),
	  but
	  it displays only white, there has been some discussion of
	  displaying the
	  shadow map, but I could not find it, the addition of a simple
	  fragment
	  shader with the appropriate color transform should get this
	  going."

2007-09-30 19:53  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "here's the osgDB::Registry changes to add
	  Options to the read*File() interface. As we discussed, this
	  preserves the old interface for backwards compatibility.
	  
	  osgconv also changed to use the new Registry::writeNode()
	  interface. No other applications or examples were affected."

	* Added hdwriter to CMake build

2007-09-30 18:42  robert

	* From David Spilling, "Please find attached an extension of the
	  Radiance HDR (RGBE) image reader to support writing.
	  
	  The options are intended to match the existing read options. By
	  default it will only write RGB32F format; if the "RAW" option is
	  selected, it will output 8 bit RGBA as "raw" RGBE. Note also that
	  the writer inserts a flipVertical(); although the RGBE format,
	  according to spec, should support top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top
	  ordering, no software I've found, including that from the formats
	  originator, actually respects this."

2007-09-30 18:33  robert

	* From Jan Peciva, "I am submitting improved Inventor (iv) writer.
	  
	  List of changes:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-09-30 15:06  robert

	* From Dan Minor, "osgText::Text does not currently have a
	  getAxisAlignment method. The
	  attached code adds this, along with a member variable to keep
	  track of
	  the setting. It is based on the latest subversion version, and
	  was
	  tested by creating a new text object with the same axis alignment
	  as an
	  existing one (e.g.
	  new_text->setAxisAlignment(old_text->getAxisAlignment()); )."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, " I originally didn't add a
	  getAxisAlignment()
	  as all setAxisAlignment does is set the Rotation member variable,
	  and
	  potentially one could apply user defined Rotation setting after
	  the
	  setAxisAlignment() which would bring it out of sync with the
	  setAxisAlignment.
	  
	  Rather than reject your submission on the ground of potentially
	  getting out of sync and therefore misleading users I've added a
	  USED_DEFINED_ROTATION to AxisAlignment enum, and set this in the
	  serRotation and then override this setting of _axisAlignment in
	  the
	  setAxisAlingment method. I've also removed the lazy updating
	  optimization you've added to the top of setAxisAlignment to avoid
	  potential problems as well."

2007-09-30 11:37  robert

	* Moved ViewerBase class out into its own header and source file.
	  
	  Improved the support for stats collection in

	* From Stephan Huber, add basic support for CompositeViewer in
	  StatsHandler

2007-09-29 11:12  robert

	* From Mattias Linde, "Nice, this almost gets the job done, one way
	  communication into the plugin is possible.
	  I've done some additional small modification regarding constness
	  in ReaderWriter and added
	  mutable on _pluginData so passing data back would be possible
	  too.
	  
	  Have updated the collada plugin (ReaderWriterDAE.cpp) to use the
	  map to handle options and
	  have attached the changes.
	  
	  The stuff in daeReader.h and daeWriter.h are just cosmetic
	  changes to get rid of a warning."

2007-09-28 13:42  robert

	* Fixed SphericalDisplay set up codes to properly manage display
	  host/num

2007-09-28 13:38  robert

2007-09-28 13:35  robert

	* From Mattias Linde, "I've attached a modified ReaderWriter header
	  which has some additions
	  to osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options to handle PluginData."

2007-09-28 08:53  robert

	* Andre Garneau, three fixes in one submissions:
	  
	  "This is a fix for the issue reported by Anders a week ago (see
	  \u201c[osg-users] BUG?: mouse coordinate changes after window
	  move\u201d discussion thread on Sept. 20). The issue was that the
	  initial implementation added a few months back was not converting
	  the window coordinates to client-area coordinates resulting in a
	  slight offset each time a decorated window was moved (caused by
	  the window border). This was also causing windows to move out of
	  their assigned screen."
	  
	  and
	  
	  "Attached is a fix for the taskbar repaint issue that occurs when
	  a graphics window is toggled from full-screen mode to windowed
	  mode (as identified by Gert van Maren a couple of weeks ago).
	  Also included is a fix derived from the \u201cEvents from the
	  past\u201d discussion thread that took place on July 11."

2007-09-27 12:47  robert

	* From Adrian Egli, "update the PSSM, i did some bug fixes and
	  added new features to move the camera virtual against the view
	  direction by applaying a simple distance factor (a), which is
	  calculated camera eye - camera center distance. and we can move
	  the "light camera" against the light direction (b).
	  
	  (a) some objects behind the camera can cast shadow
	  (b) object aboive the camera can cast shadow
	  
	  then i fixed the shadow map orientation, now screen x coordinate
	  alinged which improve the quality"

2007-09-27 12:15  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, compile fix for HP-UX without large file

	* Tweaked the wrapping of osgViewer::Scene to fix build problems

2007-09-26 10:58  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a first implementation
	  for the obj-plugin to write
	  obj-files. It is not feature complete but usable.
	  
	  Known issues:
	  * not all materials are handled correctly (especially when using
	  osg::StateAttribute::OVERRIDE), not all properties are supported
	  * could not test point and lines, all of my programs which are
	  capable
	  to read obj-files only import triangle-meshes.
	  * only simple texture-handling"

	* Removed all dome distortion correction code as this is now part
	  of the core osgViewer.
	  
	  Added viewer mode where movies are made fullscreen. One can use

	* From Mirko Viviani, "attacched you'll find the updated xcode
	  project for OpenSceneGraph
	  2.1.11. The one supplied in the archive does not build due to
	  some missing
	  file references."

2007-09-24 09:35  robert

	* From Jose Delport: "have been using the new
	  VIEW_DEPENDENT_WITH_ORTHOGRAPHIC_OVERLAY mode
	  of the OverlayNode.
	  
	  I change the overlay subgraph dynamically and when I remove all
	  the
	  subgraph nodes that is inside the current main camera FOV (others
	  outside still exist), the overlay texture does not update because
	  of the
	  early return in the traversal. I then get a kind of ghost texture
	  moving
	  around the terrain.
	  
	  The attached file fixed the problem for me, but I'm not sure if
	  it is
	  the best way to address the problem."

	  use the DDS writer" query, I was emboldened to submit this very
	  small patch. The bitmasks for RGBA and RGB have been modified in
	  the writer portion of the code (line 765 onwards). This is now
	  consistent with what the DDS plugin reads. In terms of testing,
	  note that many 3rd party applications erroneously ignore the
	  bitmasks in the file, and assume a BGRA order."

2007-09-11 17:10  robert

	* Added OpenThreads to target libraries

2007-09-11 17:08  robert

2007-09-11 16:59  robert

	* From Art Tevs, build fix.

2007-09-11 16:56  robert

	* Replaced allocateMipmap code with warning message as mipmaps
	  aren't support for TextureRectangle.

2007-09-11 13:47  robert

	* Removed the output num_children from Group .osg output and
	  removed the output of "DataVaraince UNSPECIFIED" as this is
	  redundent
	  considering the default value is UNSPECIFIED.

2007-09-11 13:42  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-09-11 13:39  robert

	* From Mathias Froenlich, "have a problem with the SunOS CC.
	  It does not like that the prototype of
	  ClipNode::setStateSetModes() differs
	  from implementation of that function in the constness of the
	  second
	  parameter.
	  On SunOS it compiles fine, but I get link errors when the variant
	  that is
	  declared in the header is referenced.
	  
	  The attached src/osg/ClipNode.cpp file removes the const
	  qualifier from the
	  implementation to match exactly the prototype in the header file.
	  The file is based on revision 7386 as of today.
	  "

2007-09-11 13:34  robert

	* From Art Trevs, "File Changes:
	  - GL2Extensions, Program and Program.cpp
	  
	  Features:
	  - Support for fragment output binding. (e.g. You can now specify
	  in the fragment shader varying out vec3 fragOut; fragOut =
	  vec3(1,0,1); to write to the fragOut variable. In your program
	  you call glBindFragDataLocation(program, 1, "fragOut") to bind
	  the fragOut variable with the MRT 1 - GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1_EXT)
	  
	  - new methods Program::add/removeBindFragDataLocation
	  Program::getFragDataBindingList
	  
	  "

2007-09-11 13:32  robert

	* Seperated out GeometryTechnique .osg support.

2007-09-11 12:28  robert

	* Changed the isTextureIntegerSupported method so that it no longer
	  has the EXT entry in it
	  for forward compatability reasons.

2007-09-11 12:04  robert

	* From Art Trevs, "Features of the patch are:
	  
	  - Implementation of integer textures as in EXT_texture_integer
	  
	  - setBorderColor(Vec4) changed to setBorderColor(Vec4d) to pass
	  double values
	  as border color. (Probably we have to provide an overloading
	  function to
	  still support Vec4f ?)
	  
	  - new method Texture::getInternalFormatType() added. Gives
	  information if the
	  internal format normalized, float, signed integer or unsigned
	  integer. Can
	  help people to write better code ;-)
	  
	  "
	  
	  Futher changes to this submission by Robert Osfield, changed the
	  dirty mipmap
	  flag into a buffer_value<> vector to ensure safe handling of
	  multiple contexts.

2007-09-11 10:16  robert

	* From Rafa Giatan, "Changed int to GLsizei in the input parameter
	  of the method
	  osg::Texture2DArray::applyTexImage2DArray_subload inside
	  Texture2DArray (lines 214 and 257), Otherwise it gives a compile
	  error on MacOSX."

2007-09-11 10:10  robert

	* From Mike Wittman and Robert Osfield, added support for
	  SO_VERSION number in

	* Maded versioning under Windows the default.

2007-09-10 15:19  robert

	* Intoduced a new setGLExtensions template method to do a copy of
	  void* pointer to
	  local function pointer to avoid compiler warnings related to case
	  void*.
	  
	  Moved various OSG classes across to using setGLExtensions instead
	  of getGLExtensions,
	  and changed them to use typedef declarations in the headers
	  rather than casts in
	  the .cpp.
	  
	  Updated wrappers

2007-09-08 07:21  robert

	* Flesh out a bit more of the view IO support

2007-09-07 13:37  robert

	* Updated wrappers for new Texture2DArray class

2007-09-07 13:25  robert

	* Moved defined from Texture2DArray into Texture

2007-09-07 11:21  robert

	* From Art Tevs,
	  
	  "A new texture class Texture2DArray derived from
	  Texture extends the osg to support the new
	  EXT_texture_array extensions. Texture arrays provides
	  a feature for people interesting in GPGPU programming.
	  
	  
	  Faetures and changes:
	  
	  - Full support for layered 2D textures.
	  
	  - New uniform types were added (sampler2DArray)
	  
	  - FrameBufferObject implementation were changed to
	  support attaching of 2D array textures to the
	  framebuffer
	  
	  - StateSet was slightly changed to support texture
	  arrays. NOTE: array textures can not be used in fixed
	  function pipeline. Thus using the layered texture as a
	  statemode for a Drawable produce invalid enumerant
	  OpenGL errors.
	  
	  - Image class was extended to support handling of
	  array textures
	  
	  Tests:
	  I have used this class as a new feature of my
	  application. It works for me without problems (Note:
	  Texture arrays were introduced only for shading
	  languages and not for fixed function pipelines!!!).
	  RTT with Texture2DArray works, as I have tested them
	  as texture targets for a camera with 6 layers/faces
	  (i.e. replacement for cube maps). I am using the array
	  textures in shader programming. Array textures can be
	  attached to the FBO and used as input and as output."

2007-09-07 10:50  robert

	* From Daniel Sjolie, "I patched the zip plugin to make use of my
	  favorite zip/pack-application for windows if it is installed in
	  the standard location..."

2007-09-07 10:15  robert

	* From Guillaume Millet, "Please find in attachment a small
	  improvement to the pfb plugin
	  CmakeLists.txt and to the FindPerformer.cmake module.
	  
	  Under Windows libs are: libpf.lib (we need to add the lib prefix)
	  and
	  libpfdu-util.lib (libpfdu and libpfutil are compiled into one
	  lib)
	  We need to add PFROOT to the search path for libs and includes
	  (default
	  environment variable for Performer path)
	  And at last we need to put PFROOT/include and
	  PFROOT/include/Performer
	  as include dir for compiling."

	* From Maria Ten, fix lat/long usage.

2007-09-07 09:49  robert

	* From Mattias Linde, "Have made the updates now. Added a std::map
	  for easy lookup if a visual node
	  is targeted by a rigid body which is the reason why the .h-file
	  was changed too.
	  So now there'll be Group as often as possible, otherwise
	  PostitionAttitudeTransform."

	  Note from Robert Osfield. A couple of lines of code in
	  ConvertToInventor.cpp
	  would not compile under g++ 4.1.2, so rather than hold back the
	  dev release till
	  this is resolved I've optional compiled out the problem section.
	  The #define DISABLE_PROBLEM_COMPILE_SECTIONS is used to compile
	  out the problem

	  GL_LUMINANCE data instead of GL_RGB data. You can easily check
	  with
	  "osgViewer --image klink1_l.tif".
	  
	  The bug is in ReaderWriterTIFF.cpp function simage_tiff_load,
	  where
	  numComponents_ret is incorrectly set to 1 instead of 3 for color
	  mapped
	  data."

2007-09-03 10:04  robert

	* From Almalric Alexandre, "I've noticed that all osgViewerMFC
	  example from osg 2.x.x are flickering when resizing 3D view, to

	  class and do nothing in it. Just like the WxWidget example.
	  
	  Attached the modified version of MFC_OSG_MDIView.cpp and
	  MFC_OSG_MDIView.h."
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfield, submission came with wrong header file,

	* From Galen Faidley," Please find attached the modifications to
	  get the new checkerboard
	  stereo format to work. It's a good thing I tested these on a TV
	  before submitting them since I did indeed have a bug. One thing I
	  did not test was to see how this would work in windowed mode.
	  Does
	  the interlaced stereo code have support for 'absolute' positions?
	  For example a given pixel on the screen is always shown in a
	  given
	  eye no matter where the graphics context is placed?
	  "

2007-08-23 14:10  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay,"As discussed yesterday on the osg-users
	  list, I have altered
	  src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp to implement the official Windows DLL
	  search
	  order as described on the page
	  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586.aspx . As
	  mentioned,
	  the search order is now:
	  1. The directory from which the application loaded.
	  2. The system directory. (C:\Windows\System32 by default, gotten
	  using the
	  GetSystemDirectory function)
	  3. The 16-bit system directory. (C:\Windows\System by default,
	  gotten by
	  adding "\System" to the path gotten in the next step...)
	  4. The Windows directory. (C:\Windows by default, gotten using
	  the
	  GetWindowsDirectory function)
	  5. The current directory. (".")
	  6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment
	  variable. (as
	  before)
	  
	  The first four directories are obtained using Win32 API calls, so
	  they
	  should work correctly even on non-standard Windows installs.
	  
	  The changes are well commented and should be clear, even to
	  someone
	  not familiar with the Win32 API.
	  
	  I have tested in a few scenarios and it works as expected. Serge
	  Lages
	  has also tested the changes and confirmed they worked as
	  described. I
	  have not had any other reports though (positive or negative).
	  
	  I also fixed the issue with a trailing semicolon on the PATH
	  adding an
	  empty string to the end of the search paths, as this was an
	  inconsistent side effect rather than a desirable effect. This
	  change
	  will take effect on other platforms as well, but since it tests
	  for an
	  empty string in the last item added to the search paths, it
	  should
	  have no adverse effect.

	* Addd control for serializing draw dispatch.

2007-08-22 19:31  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "After a bit more testing, it was still
	  not 100% robust, so this fix
	  will bring the change in line with what is done on other OSes
	  (Linux)
	  and works in all tested cases.
	  
	  For reference, this was tested with:
	  
	  osgviewer <file>.wrl (file in current directory)
	  osgviewer <dir>\<file>.wrl (file in child directory, relative)
	  osgviewer .\<dir>\<file>.wrl (file in child directory, specify

2007-08-16 15:29  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-08-16 14:13  robert

	* From Maria Ten, "I divide the init method of the
	  geometrytechnique in submethods to made more easy the inheritance
	  between the user and osg-class. This is a first step to add more
	  functions in osgTerrain. Maybe the subdivision of the method have
	  to
	  be in the terraintechnique because is the base class of
	  GeometryTechnique. If Robert or anyone think that this is better
	  i
	  change this class too."

2007-08-15 15:11  robert

	* From Jan Ciger, "I am attaching a little hack from Jean-Sebastien
	  Guay which allows
	  absolute paths to work on Windows."

2007-08-15 15:07  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "the softshadowmap-implementation does not
	  compile on os x, to be more
	  precise, the shader does not compile on os x because of some
	  type-conflicts ala "can not convert from const int to const
	  float"
	  
	  So I changed the offending lines to force the type of the vars.
	  It works
	  now on OS X (albeit very slowly, 3fps on a 7300), perhaps you
	  find the
	  changes useful. Note: perhaps there is a better way in shaders to
	  cast/convert from int to float and viceversa."

2007-08-15 15:03  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "The attached file updates the framestamp
	  and traversal number of the
	  updatevisitor in osgViewer::Viewer.
	  
	  The bug prevented DOF animations because osgSim::DOFTransform
	  checks
	  the traversal number before doing any updates."

2007-08-14 17:13  robert

	* Changed the plugin name to lower case to be consistent with the
	  way that osgDB::Registry
	  searches for only lower case plugin names.

2007-08-14 17:04  robert

	* Added string to keyword map parser.

2007-08-14 13:08  shuber

	* Updated version for 2.1.5 dev release

2007-08-13 10:31  robert

	* From Luc Frauciel, "I've done 2 main modifications :
	  1) added texture->setResizeNonPowerOfTwoHint(false); when loading
	  an
	  image. It speeds up by 10 the loading of large images.
	  2) added a --disk option : only a filelist is read, images are
	  only
	  loaded when needed. It allows to handle very large set of very
	  large
	  images that would not fit in memory. Nothing change when the
	  option is
	  not set."

2007-08-13 10:27  robert

	* From Jan Ciger, "I am attaching an improved version of the
	  OpenVRML plugin. It still uses
	  OpenVRML 0.14.3 and is without the Boost dependency.
	  
	  The changes:
	  - - Fixed loading of textures and normals when no corresponding
	  indices
	  are specified. It uses vertex indices now, compliant with the
	  VRML spec.
	  - - Added colour per vertex support.
	  - - Added group node support.
	  - - Changed the code to use osg::ref_ptr instead of naked
	  pointers to
	  avoid memory leaks.
	  - - Fixed breakage for loading files specified by relative path."

2007-08-13 10:20  robert

	* From J.P. Delport, fix of GDAL location search

2007-08-13 10:17  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "I added the ability to set the render
	  target implementaion on the
	  osgSim::OverlayNode. The attached changes were made against the
	  2.0
	  release."

2007-08-13 09:13  robert

	* Added gdal/gdal.h to header search path, and gdal1.4.1 to the lib
	  search path.

	  osgUtil::LineSegmentIntersector::setStart(osg::Vec3d) and
	  setEnd(osg::Vec3d)."

2007-08-12 13:10  robert

	* Removed now redundent osgshadowtexture and osgdepthshadow
	  examples

2007-08-12 12:15  robert

	* Added support for SoftShadowMap into osgshadow example

2007-08-12 12:15  robert

	* Added fix for typo of name in submission

2007-08-12 12:12  robert

	* From Bruno Hebelin,
	  
	  "I have adapted to osgShadow the soft shadow map technique
	  described in "Efficient Soft-Edged Shadows Using Pixel Shader
	  Branching" by Yury Uralsky, Chapter 17 of GPU Gems 2 (Matt Pharr
	  ed. Addison-Wesley).
	  
	  Here is my code in attachment: basically, it works in the same
	  way as osgShadow/ShadowMap (core code is copied from it) but
	  implements a specific GLSL shader for the soft rendering of
	  penumbra.
	  
	  I have tested it under Linux with a NVidia graphic card, but
	  there should be no dependency on platform nor on the graphics
	  driver (as far as they support GLSL 2). Screenshots attached show
	  the current results (frame rate bound to v-sync, but the shader
	  takes actually not much time)."

2007-08-11 17:44  robert

	* Added preprending of osgPlugins-version to plugin names

2007-08-11 14:49  robert

	* Added DisplaySetting::s/getCompileContextHint() and use of this
	  hint in osgViewer::Viewer/CompositeViewer.
	  
	  Removed the CustomViewer in osgterrain example as the above now
	  removes the need for it.

2007-08-11 12:43  robert

	* Refactored the use of the MasterOperation so that it now gets
	  attached to the
	  Viewer via the new Viewer::addUpdateOperation() method, rather
	  than need a
	  custom Viewer::updateTraversal().

2007-08-11 10:28  robert

	* Added support for an update OperationQueue to Viewer and
	  CompositeViewer to allow asyncrnous adding of operations to be
	  added
	  to the view to be done during syncronous updateTraversal().
	  
	  This feature can be used for doing things like merging subgraphs
	  that have been loaded
	  in a background thread.

2007-08-10 17:44  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-08-10 10:52  robert

	* Refactored the way the Scene is used in Viewer and

	  that only on Scene exists per scene graph.

2007-08-09 08:19  robert

	* Compile fix

	* Renamed osgTerrain::TerrainNode to osgTerrain::Terrain and
	  introduced basic
	  .osg read support for osgTerrain::Terrain.
	  

2007-08-07 15:51  robert

	* Removed TerrainNode.cpp from CMakeLists.txt

2007-08-07 15:30  robert

	* Added preliminary shell of osgTerrain plugin

2007-08-07 14:49  robert

	* From Luc Fruciel, "Gdal plugins reads lots of information that is
	  not taken into account in ReadHeigthField for example.
	  Attached a modification that read the HeigthField position and
	  X,Yintervals.
	  I also removed the limitation to 1024*1024 to 4096*4096, because
	  when you are preprocessing your data with OSG, it can be useful
	  to read large images/heigthfields. Is there a reason (other than
	  hardware limitations for textures) for this limit ?"

2007-08-07 10:37  robert

	* Re-introduceed GDAL plugin

2007-08-07 10:33  robert

	* Re-introduced GDAL plugin.

2007-08-07 10:31  robert

	* Added preliminary code to allow build specification of glu
	  tesscallback with ... parameter

2007-08-07 08:18  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, The attached file adds #include <stdlib.h> to

	* Added support for enabling the stencil buffer when horizontal and
	  vertical split stereo are used.

2007-08-05 14:59  robert

	* From Tim More, "This patch causes GraphicsWindowX11 to not send
	  key release events when a key
	  press / release is caused by auto-repeat. This is consistent with
	  Windows and Mac
	  behavior, as well as other toolkits such as SDL."

2007-08-05 14:51  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, fixes for avoiding warnings about mixing c and
	  c++ versions of c libs.

	  able to fix this
	  threading model

2007-08-04 10:30  robert

	* From John Shue, "Recent changes to sockstream.cpp and
	  sockinet.cpp to better deal with
	  various operating system differences between socklen_t and int
	  have
	  broken the FreeBSD build. Change was to add __FreeBSD__ to the
	  list of
	  defines that are checked."

	* Updated version number for 2.1.3 dev release

2007-07-30 10:52  robert

	* Ported across Viewer's to use osgUtil::GLObjectOperation, added
	  second option
	  in GLObjectOperation to handle cases when no subgraph is
	  registered, in these
	  case the code now compile all Camera subgraphs.

2007-07-28 10:44  robert

	* From Andy Skinner, adding C includes to avoid issues when mixing
	  C and C++ standard includes

2007-07-28 10:28  robert

	* Introduce Camera::s/getRenderer().

2007-07-27 17:16  robert

	* From David Callu, "After the mail of Emmanuel Roche to convert a
	  void * in a known pointer (for example osg::Geode *), I has
	  searched an elegant way to introduce this feature.
	  
	  I just add ReinterpretCastConverter in the Reflector to convert
	  void* in T* and T* in void*

	* Updated svn::externals

2007-07-26 19:31  robert

	* From Thibault Genessay, "Attached is an unitialized variable fix
	  I spotted with Purify. The _currentCursor (of type HCURSOR)
	  member of the graphics window was not properly initialized,
	  causing potential problems if setCursor() was called before
	  anything else set it."

2007-07-25 10:12  robert

	* From Parag Chaudhur, "In daeRMaterials.cpp in the COLLADA plugin,
	  in the processTexture function, Lines 519-522
	  of the source file:
	  
	  The "delete [] path" appears before the "osg::notify", causing
	  the data pointed to by
	  "filename" to be deleted before access causing an access
	  violation.

	  with the example osgviewerMFC where the MFC rendering thread
	  would not exit before the application and the thread would be
	  left running in the background and the user would have to use
	  TaskManager to kill the process.
	  
	  Changes:
	  
	  MFC_OSG.cpp:

2007-07-05 10:51  robert

	* Commented out "fix" that explictly sets the key modifier state as

2007-07-03 17:32  robert

	* From Thibault Genessay, "You'll find attached a fix for the
	  comments of the osgwindows example. It fixes a typo in the
	  comments which is quite disturbing for newbies trying to learn
	  using the source (twice 'left' instead of 'left' and 'right').
	  I've also added a little offset to the windows' positions so that

2007-06-30 16:19  robert

	* From Mike Connell, "This is a tiny fix for win32.
	  
	  The current code takes the mouse cursor position and adds it to
	  the
	  window (left,top) position, and sends the mouse cursor there. But
	  this
	  doesn't take into account the window decoration.
	  
	  The new code converts the given (x,y) coordinates from the client
	  area
	  coordinate system to the screen instead using ClientToScreen. I
	  think
	  this is the natural windows way to do it.
	  
	  Tested on XP with osgviewer
	  "

2007-06-30 14:21  robert

	* From David Callu,
	  
	  "
	  Found in the join file the fix for the bug found by Rafa.
	  
	  
	  Problem :
	  
	  osgIntrospection::Value grp(new osg::Group);
	  
	  osgIntrospection::ValueList vlcall;
	  vlcall.push_back(osgIntrospection::Value("toto"));
	  
	  const osgIntrospection::MethodInfo *m =
	  grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod("setName", vlcall, true);
	  
	  if (m)
	  {
	  m->invoke(grp, vlcall); // ** SEGFAULT here
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Algorithm explanation :
	  
	  The "invoke" method try to convert "grp", which reflect an
	  "osg::Group*", in a
	  "osgIntrospection::Value", which reflect a "osg::Node*".
	  This because
	  the "setName(const char *)" method found by
	  "grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod"
	  is an "osg::Object" type method.
	  
	  When osgIntrospection do this conversion it try :
	  - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to found a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to converte an Enum to int or unsigned int
	  - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
	  then converte this string in the destination value
	  
	  Else it throw a "TypeConversionException".
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Bug :
	  
	  1)
	  When osgIntrospection try to found a chain of
	  "osgIntrospection::Converter"
	  It could do any downcast or (Type to SuperType) or upcast
	  (SuperType to Type).
	  This mean the the chain could be :
	  osg::Group to osg::Transform to osg::Camera to
	  osg::CullSettings to osg::CullStack to
	  osg::CollectOccludersVisitor to
	  osg::NodeVisitor to osg::Referenced to osg::Object
	  
	  During the convertion with this chain, A METTRE failed and
	  the pointer in
	  "grp" is set NULL. But the "grp" is always a valid
	  "osgIntrospection::Value"
	  and so, osgIntrospection accept the conversion. Then it try
	  to use this pointer
	  to call the "setName" function. And Bing SEGFAULT.
	  
	  
	  2)
	  In "bool Reflection::accum_conv_path( ... )"
	  the convection path isn't accumulate in the recursive loop.
	  this cause multi request of a conversion path, and a
	  slowdown in the
	  conversion algorithm.
	  
	  3)
	  Use of the last conversion way in a conversion from
	  pointer to pointer
	  this mean you can do this :
	  "osg::Node*" to " value string representation" to
	  "osg::Material*"
	  What a bad thing !!!
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Solution :
	  
	  1)
	  Introduce the concept of dynamic_cast and static_cast.
	  now, to do a conversion, osgIntrospection does this :
	  
	  - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to found a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  only with static_cast, downcast (Type to SuperType)
	  
	  - to found, if the source and the destination are two pointer,
	  a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  only with dynamic_cast, upcast (SuperType to Type)
	  
	  - to convert an Enum to int or to unsigned int
	  - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
	  then convert this string in the destination value
	  
	  Else it throw a "TypeConversionException".
	  
	  
	  Add the "enum CastType" to distinguish the static_cast or
	  dynamic_cast converter.
	  Add file OpenSceneGraph/include/osgIntrospection/CastType
	  
	  2)
	  add a line to accumulate converter in converter Path.
	  
	  3)
	  add a line to check if source and destination are pointer.

	* From Stephan Huber and Robert Osfield,
	  
	  Stephan: "attached you'll find some modifications to the
	  GraphicsWindow-class and
	  their platform-dependant implementations.
	  
	  The problem:
	  setWindowRectangle and setWindowDecoration do not update the
	  traits-object, so, if you call setWindowRectangle on a
	  not-realized-window it will open with another size when realized
	  later.
	  getWindowRectangle reports possible wrong sizes if
	  setWindowRectangle
	  called before.
	  
	  My solution:
	  split the implementation in two parts:
	  GraphicsWindow::setWindowRectangle will update its traits-object
	  and
	  call afterwards the virtual method
	  setWindowRectangleImplementation
	  (which is implemented by the derived platformspecific classess).
	  For
	  setWindowDecoration I am useing a similar mechanism.
	  
	  I hope you'll find the submission useful, the Win32 and X11
	  changes are
	  not tested but should work."
	  
	  Changes to this made by Robert are call of resized in
	  setWindowRectangle
	  instead of setting of Traits, and use of a bool return type.

2007-06-08 10:58  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "We have a few OpenFlight files that used to
	  display properly with the
	  old loader, but appear very, very wrong with the new one. I
	  traced the
	  problem to the handling of the palette override flags in the
	  external
	  reference records. The current behavior for handling the palette
	  override flags for external references has different offsets for
	  different OpenFlight version (2 bytes for 14.2-15.1 and 4 bytes
	  for 15.2
	  and later). However, I believe this behavior is incorrect.
	  
	  I know that the original 14.2 OpenFlight spec (dated April 1995)
	  specifies 2 bytes between the filename and the override flags,
	  and the
	  15.4 and later specs specify 4 bytes. However, I also found a
	  14.2.4
	  OpenFlight spec (dated January 1996) that changes the
	  specification to 4
	  bytes. Also, the databases in question were created using an old
	  IRIX
	  version of MultiGen II, which wrote OpenFlight 14.2 files
	  natively.
	  These files also have 4 bytes between the filename and flags.
	  Furthermore, these databases have always worked properly under
	  earlier
	  versions of OSG, under Performer, and in every MultiGen product
	  we've used.
	  
	  This leads me to believe that the original 14.2 spec was
	  incorrect (the
	  14.2.4 spec corrected this error), and there should be 4 bytes
	  between
	  the filename and flags for all OpenFlight files version 14.2 and
	  later.
	  
	  The attached fix modifies the OpenFlight loader to behave in this
	  way."

2007-06-08 10:22  robert

	* From Jason Daly, "This changes the handling of textures in the
	  OpenFlight loader.
	  Currently, if the texture attribute file doesn't explicitly
	  specify an
	  internal format, the loader will force it to use GL_RGB, which
	  keeps
	  translucent textures (eg. GL_RGBA textures) from showing up
	  properly.
	  
	  This patch changes the default behavior to simply use the image's
	  format
	  instead of forcing a particular format."

2007-06-08 10:16  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "So, something strange happened to the repo and
	  some of this project's
	  files got messed up, most notiably the Nib and also the Localized
	  strings file. I didn't notice the latter until now so Martin is
	  missing this file.
	  
	  Anyway, the attached tar contains all new versions of all the
	  necessary files. There are cleanups and fixes to a lot of things.
	  Martin did a good job porting the thing to osg::Viewer so most of
	  the
	  code changes I made address other areas.
	  
	  Two things I noticed in the new port you might want to consider
	  as
	  feedback. First, there might be a bug with osgViewer when the
	  view
	  size goes to 0. If you play with the splitviews in this program
	  and
	  shrink the view until it is closed, and then re-expand it, the
	  model
	  doesn't come back, not even after a home() call. SimpleViewer
	  didn't
	  have this problem.
	  
	  Second, a more minor thing, this program has a
	  take-screenshot--and-copy-to-clipboard feature via Cmd-C (or Menu
	  item). I achieve this by using osg::Camera to render to an FBO
	  and
	  then copy the contents to Cocoa. To insert the camera, I
	  manipulate
	  the scenegraph so I can get the camera node in and out. I end up
	  calling setSceneData at the end of eveything to restore
	  everything to
	  the original state before I started mucking with the scenegraph.
	  This
	  unfortunately, triggers a home() reset. So in this particular
	  case, it
	  make Copy look like it's changing the scene. The old SimpleViewer
	  had
	  the same problem, but I was able to work around it by directly
	  invoking the underlying SceneView's setSceneData so the home()
	  mechanism was bypassed. The viewer design seems to protect this
	  data
	  more carefully so the bypass trick won't work. My feedback is
	  that
	  maybe a flag or extra parameter can be introduced so a reset is
	  not
	  triggered if not desired.
	  
	  I have checked in a ton of Xcode fixes for the entire build
	  process in
	  general so once this piece gets checked in, hopefully everything
	  will
	  build cleanly."

	* From Mike Wittman, "This change to genwrapper and
	  osgIntrospection gives access to
	  the declaring file for a given type via the new member function
	  osgIntrospection::Type::getDeclaringFile. This information is
	  useful
	  in order to know what header to include when auto-generating

	  During the C# wrapper generator development I've been keeping the

	  extremely valuable to get this change in before 2.0 to reduce
	  maintenance
	  during the lifetime of the release. It'll also be equally useful
	  to
	  others looking to create wrapper generators using
	  osgIntrospection.
	  
	  This is a fairly simple change and was tested with a fresh
	  rebuild of the
	  entire suite of osgWrapper libraries, so it should be relatively
	  low risk
	  (fingers crossed)."

2007-06-08 09:45  robert

	* Added clean up of the view before destruction of the window

2007-06-08 09:17  robert

	* Added const get*Matrix() methods

2007-06-08 05:03  ewing

	* Changed the version to 2.0.0 in the Info.plist in anticipation of
	  the official release.
	  I don't know what the OpenThreads version number will be, so that
	  has been left alone.

2007-06-08 04:57  ewing

	* Lots of various fixes to Xcode project.
	  
	  - Adding missing header files and making sure they are marked
	  public.
	  
	  - Support to copy headers in Viewer/api into the proper location
	  in framework
	  
	  - Internalized OpenThreads build so cross-project dependency is
	  not needed. Can now delete copy of OpenThreads project.
	  Frameworks use native Xcode linking mechanism. Plugins/Examples
	  still use explicit -framework OpenThreads. Could potentially be
	  problem is old OpenThreads is on the system. This can be changed
	  to use native mechanism too, but requires some patience because
	  it is tedious to change.
	  
	  - Lots of fixes to osgViewerCocoa (something got messed up pretty
	  badly...files are missing from repo). Another submission will
	  need to readd these files back.

2007-06-06 15:22  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, "on my MacOS X/cmake setup the zlib plugin
	  isn't built by default. This may be because zlib.h is
	  installed in /opt/local/include on my system (courtesy of
	  DarwinPorts). I've added a CMakeModule to
	  look for zlib.h and the library in various places. The files are

2007-06-02 15:31  robert

	* Added osgViewer::GraphicsWindowEmbedded and ported GLUT, SDL and
	  WX examples across from SimpleViewer to Viewer.

2007-06-02 12:03  robert

	* Ported GLUT example to using osgViewer::Viewer rather than
	  SimpleViewer by using
	  a local GraphicsWindowEmbedded class to help the adaption.

2007-06-01 22:41  robert

	* Renamed all osgsimpleviewer* files to osgviewer*

2007-06-01 22:28  robert

	* updated wrapper

2007-06-01 21:38  robert

	* From J.P Delport, "attached find an updated osgunittests.cpp that
	  allows for the testing of
	  the matrix.getRotate() function when a matrix contains a scale as
	  well
	  as a rotation.
	  
	  The scale can optionally be switched off, see the top of
	  testQuatFromMatrix().
	  
	  As expected, all the current methods for mat to quat conversion
	  fail
	  these new tests. When the scale is omitted, mk2 of getRotate with
	  sign
	  instead of signOrZero passes, as well as mk1.
	  "

2007-06-01 21:33  robert

	* From Maria Ten, "The constructor method of the EllipsoidLocator
	  of osgTerrain assumes
	  that the terrain is always the Earth planet. I changed the
	  constructor
	  method to accept the Equator radius and the Polar radius like
	  parameters. By default, it assumes the Earth radius for the
	  EllipsoidLocator. I added a setEllipsoidModel method, too.
	  
	  Now, we are developing some libraries for a GIS applicacion, and
	  our
	  libraries can visualize terrains of planets like Mars. I think
	  that is
	  a interesting change."

2007-06-01 21:28  robert

	* From Michael Hartman, "CMakeLists.txt:
	  
	  Changed this back to setup_example since WIN32 flag is now
	  supported.
	  
	  
	  
	  MFC_OSG.h:
	  
	  Added flag to indicate when the rendering thread has exited.
	  
	  
	  
	  MFC_OSG.cpp:
	  
	  Code modifications to support rendering flag thread exit.
	  
	  
	  
	  MFC_OSG_MDIView.cpp:
	  
	  Change to OnDestroy function to wait until we get render thread
	  exit flag is true before we close the window.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Main Exit Process:
	  
	  User presses escape button
	  
	  Viewer captures escape button and stops threading etc.
	  
	  Viewer sets Done when shutdown is complete
	  
	  MFC Render Thread monitors viewer->done for true
	  
	  MFC Render Thread exits while loop and sets MFC Done flag
	  
	  MFC View Window monitors MFC Done flag and then closes/destroys
	  the window
	  
	  "

2007-06-01 19:53  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-06-01 19:45  robert

	* From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I did few tests to see whether adding
	  PreDraw callback would help us with SPI problems when using
	  Viewer. Results were positive so I decided to give it a try and
	  ask you to verify and maybe merge with existing codebase.
	  
	  I added _preDrawCallback member and neccessary access methods
	  plus modified osgUtil RenderStage.cpp to invoke it before all
	  drawInner calls are made. I tried to maintain symmetry with
	  postDrawCallback but you know better where is a proper place for
	  this call ;-)
	  "

2007-06-01 19:44  robert

	* Updates to OverlayData

2007-06-01 19:43  robert

	* From Mathias Froelich, "have done an interface to change the
	  mouse cursor in the X11 graphics
	  window.
	  The win32 implementation is still in its original shape since I
	  have no win32
	  implementation available.
	  
	  I have chosen the enum approach for the first cut. That is
	  benefitial since
	  the user does not need to track creation of mouse cursors for
	  different
	  windows and displays in presence of multiple viewer windows.
	  
	  The default set of available mouse shapes is the same set that
	  was available
	  with glut. That set served many OpenGL applications well, so the
	  hope is that
	  this is enough.
	  
	  Even though, that implementation is still extensible:
	  I have digged out the way SDL defines new mouse cursors and added
	  a still
	  documented out function prototype in the GraphicsWindow that can
	  be used to
	  extend the current implemtation for arbitrary mouse shapes. That
	  is not
	  implemented yet.
	  
	  I hope that somebody with a win32 test system can catch up that
	  implementation
	  on win32."

2007-06-01 19:21  robert

	* Removed setViewUpOnScreen settings

2007-06-01 19:19  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find the modified
	  ImageStream
	  and a small fix for QuicktimeImageStream to disable debug-logging
	  :)"

2007-06-01 19:10  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "Just found another issue building the C#
	  wrappers: the osgTerrain ValidDataOperator file uses osg::Vec2,
	  osg::Vec3, and osg::Vec4, but does not include their headers. The
	  file with the relevant includes is attached.
	  
	  "

2007-06-01 19:01  robert

	* Removed the debug message for the ortho path.

	* Changed name of AnimationPathHandler to RecordCameraPathHandler

2007-06-01 10:39  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, new event handler to record the camera path. A
	  few small tweaks by Robert Osfield to make it more consistent
	  with the old osgProducer::Viewer behavior.

2007-05-30 17:56  robert

	* Improved taper ratio computation

	* From Stephan Huber, updated OpenThreads-XCode-project files

2007-05-29 13:28  robert

	* Added support for specifying which screen number to place the
	  window

2007-05-29 10:31  robert

	* From Sherman Wilcox, "The issue itself occurs when a model is
	  tessellated
	  that has greater than unsigned short number of vertexes. An
	  object
	  called vertexPtrToIndexMap contains vertexes and their indexes.
	  This
	  std::map object can obviously hold a quantity that is greater
	  than
	  unsigned short, however osg::DrawElementsUShort objects were
	  being
	  created to reference these vertexes and their indexes.
	  osg::DrawElementsUShort can only hold indexes that are 16-bit
	  quantities.
	  
	  ...
	  
	  proposed_patch_2\tessellator.cpp. This solution examines the size
	  of
	  vertexPtrToIndexMap and selects 1 of 3 possible osg::DrawElements
	  objects: DrawElementsUByte, DrawElementsUShort, or
	  DrawElementsUInt.
	  The main drawback of this particular solution is the code
	  duplication.
	  However, the repair is straightforward."

2007-05-29 10:01  robert

	* From Olaf Flebbe, "recently I discovered that the freetype plugin
	  does not work, because
	  CMake doesn't recognize it properly on windows.
	  
	  1) the header detection on a directory "freetype" fails, it seems
	  to
	  need a filename: "ft2build.h" actually works.
	  
	  2) the 3rdparty I am supplying for FlightGear contains
	  freetype-2.3.4. I
	  added the correct library naming for this particular release.
	  
	  I double-checked my directory layout with the 3rdparty supplied
	  by other
	  OSG contributors."

2007-05-29 09:57  robert

	* From Olar Flebbe, "Visual Studio 2005 triggered a small glitch in
	  UnittestFramework.cpp
	  
	  Do not derefence it2 if it is at end()."

2007-05-29 07:25  robert

2007-05-28 10:14  robert

	* From Frauciel Luc, "Added support for other pointers than mouses
	  by using a nearpoint and farpoint instead of mousex,mousey +
	  Camera (see Dragger and Dragger.cpp).
	  The major modification concern the LineProjector class in
	  Projector.cpp. The intersection was previously done in window
	  space, I've modified it to compute it in object space."

2007-05-28 09:30  robert

	* From Blake Williams, "I discovered why the \u2013CompositeViewer
	  option for the osghud example does not work. The run() function
	  adds a camera manipulator to each view that does not have one
	  assigned, which causes the view with the HUD camera to point
	  somewhere other than where it should. I just added a check before
	  a new default camera manipulator is added to ensure that the view
	  allows event focus before a camera manipulator is added."

	* From Charles Cole, "Attached are mods to the OpenFlight plug-in
	  to help further implement
	  the specification. With these mods, blink sequences are now
	  created for
	  flashing light point nodes, either palletized (v.15.8 and later)
	  or
	  non-palletized (15.7 and earlier). Thanks to Brede for his
	  implementation of the palletized light point nodes.
	  
	  There is still work to do on adding the capability to properly
	  handle
	  light point system nodes, but this does add some capability that
	  did not
	  previously exist. So, I wanted to at least submit this and I will
	  hopefully provide the additional capability in the near future.
	  
	  I've tested the code modifications with Visual Studio 2005. I
	  don't
	  have the means to test any other operating system, but I would
	  suspect
	  that there shouldn't be any issue (famous last words). I used the
	  test
	  files that I uploaded to the users forum to test the changes.
	  
	  In addition to the added capability, I changed the light point
	  node
	  radius to the "actualPixelSize" value in the file. Previously,
	  the
	  radius was set to half the actual pixel size (see
	  LightPointRecords.cpp). Not sure why this was the case. But, it
	  was
	  brought to my attention by a co-worker who created the OpenFlight
	  files
	  and was testing them with different viewers. If there's some
	  history
	  for setting the radius to half the size, then this change can be
	  omitted."

2007-05-26 15:17  robert

	* Added exclude of svn directories.

2007-05-25 19:35  robert

	* From Charles Cole, "he attached code
	  implements the LightPointSystem class to allow for the OpenFlight
	  plug-in to read and handle light point system nodes. The behavior
	  is
	  very similar to the old plug-in in that a MultiSwitch node is
	  created to
	  handle the "enabled" flag bit set in the node record. The code
	  also
	  reverts the changes for the actualPixelSize as mentioned above.
	  And
	  lastly, the code requires the previously submitted changes for
	  the
	  plug-in.
	  
	  As for the other changes, I've tested the code with Visual Studio
	  2005
	  and the files that I posted in the users forum.
	  
	  With all of the submitted changes, the OpenFlight plug-in should
	  now be
	  capable of loading files with light point system nodes and the
	  use of
	  palletized light points and non-palletized light points.

	* From Peter Hrenka, (note from Robert Osfield, renamed
	  GenericPrimitiveFunctor mention below to
	  TemplatePrimitiveFunctor).
	  
	  "Since we desperately needed a means for picking Lines
	  and Points I implemented (hopefully!) proper geometrical tests
	  for the PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  First of all I implemented a new "GenericPrimiteFunctor"
	  which is basically an extended copy TriangleFunctor which also
	  handles Points, Lines and Quads through suitable overloads of
	  operator(). I would have liked to call it "PrimitiveFunctor"
	  but that name was already used...
	  I used a template method to remove redundancy in the
	  drawElements method overloads. If you know of platforms where
	  this will not work I can change it to the style used
	  in TriangleFunctor.
	  
	  In PolytopeIntersector.cpp I implemented a
	  "PolytopePrimitiveIntersector" which provides the needed
	  overloads for Points, Lines, Triangles and Quads to
	  the GenericPrimitiveFunctor. This is then used in the
	  intersect method of PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  Implementation summary:
	  - Points: Check distance to all planes
	  - Lines: Check distance of both ends against each plane.
	  If both are outside -> line is out
	  If both are in -> continue checking
	  One is in, one is out -> compute intersection point (candidate)
	  Then check all candidates against all other polytope
	  planes. The remaining candidates are the proper
	  intersection points of the line with the polytope.
	  - Triangles: Perform Line-Checks for all edges of the
	  triangle as above. If there is an proper intersection
	  -> done.
	  In the case where there are more than 2 polytope
	  plane to check against we have to check for the case
	  where the triangle encloses the polytope.
	  In that case the intersection lines of the polytope
	  planes are computed and checked against the triangle.
	  - Quads: handled as two triangles.
	  
	  This is implementation is certainly not the fastest.
	  There are certainly ways and strategies to improve it.
	  
	  
	  I also enabled the code for PolytopeIntersector
	  in osgkeyboardmouse and added keybindings to
	  switch the type of intersector ('p') and the picking
	  coordinate system ('c') on the fly. Since the
	  PolytopeIntersector does not have a canonical
	  ordering for its intersections (as opposed to
	  the LineSegementIntersector) I chaged the
	  implementation to toggle all hit geometries.
	  
	  
	  I tested the functionality with osgkeyboardmouse
	  and several models and it seems to work for
	  polygonal models. Special nodes such as billboards
	  do not work.
	  
	  
	  The next thing on my todo-list is to implement
	  a an improved Intersection-Structure for the
	  PolytopeIntersector. We need to know
	  which primitives where hit (and where).

	* From Stephan Huber, "I cleaned the code a little bit and improved
	  the handling of loops:
	  
	  I added a new protected virtual method to ImageStream called
	  applyLoopingMode() which is called from setLoopingMode. The
	  quicktime-plugin has an implementation of applyLoopingMode which
	  sets
	  some flags for the quicktime, so that quicktime handles the loop
	  playback by itself.
	  
	  This has some benefits:
	  
	  + no gaps when looping audio
	  + simplified code
	  
	  Attached you'll find the modified files, hope you'll find them
	  useful."

	  for osgviewerMFC inclusion is listed below.
	  
	  
	  
	  CMakeList.txt:
	  
	  This is a little different than other example cmakelist.txt files
	  in that I could not use the setup_example macro. I had to go in
	  and extract out the important parts of the macro and inline them
	  in the CMakeList.txt file so that I could add the WIN32
	  declaration into the ADD_EXECUTABLE() statement. In the future
	  the setup_example macro might be modified to support osgviewerMFC

	  MFC_OSG.h:

	  Void PostFrameUpdate(void);
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  MFC_OSG.cpp:

	  the osgsimpleviewerQt4 example in my Visual studio solutions...
	  After
	  looking into it it seems that you cannot have both Qt3 and Qt4
	  enabled. After modifying the root CMakeLists.txt to use :
	  
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt) which should ask you to choose betwwen Qt3 and
	  Qt4
	  if you have both
	  
	  instead of :
	  
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt3)
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)
	  
	  I had the project generated. But then due to the way CMake

	  binary
	  link with QtOpengl4. "

2007-05-15 11:25  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I made a modification to the
	  setClientActiveTextureUnit and
	  setActiveTextureUnit methods of osg::State so they return false
	  if the
	  texture unit is outside the range of allowable units for the
	  driver.
	  Currently, the functions would return true even if the units are
	  invalid. This would cause the osg::State to become out of sync
	  with
	  the actual driver state, which can cause some bugs in certain
	  cases.
	  
	  The change I made would verify that the unit passed to
	  setClientActiveTextureUnit is below GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS, and
	  the

	* From Mike Weiblen, with mods of using references by Robert
	  Osfield for efficiency. Submission notes from Mike:
	  "By repurpose, I'm creating a new plugin that uses much of the
	  .osg fileformat,
	  but with some changes. Specifically, I'm creating a ".osgfs"
	  plugin, which
	  represents the scenegraph hierarchy as a filesystem of nested
	  subdirectories and
	  individual files for each node, rather than nested braces with
	  everything in a
	  single monolithic file. I intend to incorporate file alteration
	  monitor events
	  to watch the filesystem for modifications and automatically
	  reload.
	  
	  The problem I'm running into is osgDB is too tightly coupled to
	  the .osg format.
	  osgDB::Output::writeObject() contains literal .osg
	  format-specific strings like
	  "{" to represent the Object hierarchy at too low a semantic
	  level. I propose
	  using virtual methods; my plugin can then derive from
	  osgDB::Output and
	  represent Object hiearchy differently.

	  It is non-critical and does not affect existing program
	  functionality.

	  a list of extensions: ArchiveExtensionList _archiveExtList;
	  
	  and an "add" method: addArchiveExtension(const std::string ext)

	  Registry::read() where the list is searched for the extension
	  used.
	  
	  Archive.cpp

	  Here are more changes for the CMake scripts:
	  
	  - I removed CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in FindOpenThreads as a follow
	  up to
	  the discussion thread.
	  
	  - I introduced an experimental CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to replace it.
	  
	  - I added CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, and
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to the CMake GUI so users can enter values
	  there
	  instead of in the environment.
	  
	  - I added OPENSCENEGRAPH_*_VERSION variables (MAJOR, MINOR,
	  PATCH).
	  These should be kept up-to-date with the real version numbers.
	  Mac
	  bundles like to have version information so users can find out
	  the
	  version they are running through standard About panels and also
	  automated system reporters for troubleshooting/bug tracking. In
	  theory, this information could be used for library versioning.
	  We should do the same for OpenThreads, but I forgot about it.

2007-04-25 09:32  robert

	* From Martin Aumueller, "
	  a collegue of mine noticed that on Windows and X11 the modifier
	  state (such as
	  Alt or Ctrl) would be applied one key press too late: e.g. press
	  & hold Alt,
	  press a, release Alt, press a, press a would generate the key
	  sequence a,
	  Alt-a, a instead of Alt-a, a, a.
	  
	  The problem is also present on Carbon. Moving the call to
	  setModKeyMask in
	  front of the call to keyPress fixed it for me on Carbon and X11.
	  I suppose
	  that this will fix the problem for Windows as well."

2007-04-25 09:21  robert

	* From Eric Wing,
	  "These enhancements make it much easier to control which
	  libraries get
	  found by FIND_ using environmental variables. The problem with
	  the old
	  script was that CMake searches what it considers system paths
	  first.
	  This makes it difficult to override in the case where you might
	  have a
	  stable version in /usr/local, but are trying to build a bleeding
	  edge
	  release in the non-standard location /bleeding-edge.
	  
	  I went to the CMake mailing list hoping to find a good solution
	  to
	  this. Unfortunately, there isn't one, and I have to do something
	  rather bone-headed in the Find module. Basically, I have to run
	  FIND_
	  twice: once with default search paths turned off and my
	  environmental
	  variables listed, and again with standard search paths reenabled.
	  At
	  least it works.
	  
	  I also added a few more environmental variables, specifically:
	  OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  
	  These two variables address the shortcoming of OPENTHREADS_DIR in
	  the
	  case where the include path and library path don't share a common
	  parent.
	  
	  Put all this together, and you can setup an automated shell
	  script or
	  Microsoft .bat file to configure and build your application in an
	  automated step.
	  
	  
	  You still should be able to use the key CMake variables like
	  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to find things, but it
	  will
	  occur after the environmental paths are searched. The reason for
	  this
	  is that the OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR and OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  are
	  more specific. This prevents the accidental ordering problem
	  where you
	  might use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to find some other component like
	  GLUT,
	  but didn't want to accidentally include an older version of
	  OpenThreads located in the same area.
	  
	  As the ultimate override, you can still pass -DVAR=value
	  arguments to
	  cmake and it will take these above all else. However, it's safer
	  for
	  people to not use these in case we modify the script and change
	  the
	  variable names.
	  
	  Finally, I'm wondering if we can kill the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
	  searches in the Find module. As I've said before, this is kind of
	  a
	  hack and the variable wasn't really intended to be used in this
	  way.
	  And I just got bitten by it in some bad corner cases. The problem
	  is
	  that if you don't explicitly set the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX},
	  CMake
	  sets a default value for it (such as /usr/local). The problem is
	  that
	  /usr/local may not be the place you want searched. If you wait to
	  set
	  the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} in the ccmake GUI, then FIND_ is
	  already
	  run once on ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local. If you were
	  planning to
	  change the value in the GUI, it's too late if you had a stuff in
	  /usr/local because FIND_ already found something and won't change
	  the
	  value when you reconfigure since it is already set. You will have
	  to
	  manually change the value yourself. Furthermore, as another
	  problem
	  example, on the Mac, /Library/Frameworks is supposed to be
	  searched
	  before /usr/local, but ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} kept causing stuff
	  in
	  /usr/local to be hit first which took me a really long time to
	  understand how this was happenning. The work around is that I
	  must
	  push the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} search to the very end as not to
	  conflict with anything else. But I think it would be much better
	  if we
	  removed it entirely.
	  
	  And with so many different environmental variables at our
	  disposal, I
	  don't think we need this one:
	  
	  (Checked by CMake automatically:)
	  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
	  CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
	  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
	  PATH
	  LIB
	  
	  (Checked by us:)
	  OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_DIR
	  OSG_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OSG_LIBRARY_DIR
	  OSG_DIR
	  "

2007-04-25 09:16  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "lwo must link to osgFX or undefined symbols
	  ensue."

2007-04-25 09:14  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "I made a mistake in my IF() checks for
	  FOO_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE.
	  I was using ${FOO_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE} instead of just
	  FOO_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE.
	  
	  In this case, it happened to work out to still be correct, but in
	  general it shouldn't have the ${}. (I really hate this syntax.)"

2007-04-24 19:08  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, Added check for image transluceny to image
	  loaded code, placing
	  the image quad into the transparent bin for images with alpha
	  values.

2007-04-24 19:03  robert

	* From Martin Aumueller, "the new Inventor plugin needs some
	  changes in order to compile against OpenInventor.
	  Just as in the pre-r6419 I used the COIN_BASIC_H define in order
	  to discriminate
	  between the two versions of Inventor.
	  
	  Additionally, I had to change the CMakeLists.txt to use the
	  proper include path.
	  "

2007-04-24 13:12  robert

	* From Jan Peciva,
	  "I was working on a new version of Inventor plugin.
	  It was inspired by the need to get correct and high quality
	  conversion,
	  so I verified the plugin on complex models and made number of
	  serious fixes:
	  
	  - the geometry is not two times on the output file (!)
	  - SoVRMLImageTexture: VRML texture support was rewritten
	  according to
	  Inventor programming practices, since it does not worked
	  correctly on
	  many models (Anyway, thanks for Gerrick Bivins to introduce it.)
	  - osg::ref wrong usage related crash fixed
	  - code cleaning and texture code overhaul
	  - LOD fixes
	  - appended README.txt with all the contributors I was able to get
	  from
	  SVN logs"

	* Added --version-number support

2007-04-22 21:18  robert

	* From Michael Platings, "In the "new method" 3DS loader, inverse
	  matrices were applied to
	  vertices, but not normals, which caused some models to appear
	  with
	  normals doubly rotated. I've now added some code to transform the
	  normals."

2007-04-22 20:19  robert

	* Unified the setup of version numbers so that they all are based
	  on the version

	  most window on the lowest screen number.
	  
	  Added ability for StatsHandler and HelpHandler to support end
	  users setting their
	  Camera's graphics context.

2007-04-20 16:15  robert

	* Added delay between sequential threading model changes to prevent
	  the system from locking up
	  with 'm' is held down, which previous would cause the threading
	  model to be thrashed.

2007-04-16 19:40  robert

	* From Jason Howlett, using suggestion from Robert Osfield,
	  "CullVisitor.cpp was modified, beginning at line 1115. Code was
	  added to
	  check if the camera inherits its cull mask. If not, the
	  CullVisitor sets
	  its traversal mask to the camera's cull mask."

2007-04-16 19:34  robert

	* Implement basic TerrainGeometry code

2007-04-16 18:33  robert

	  for development releases, odd versions for stable releases.

2007-04-15 20:53  robert

	* Fixed choice of display

2007-04-15 12:09  robert

	* Added different cmake version requirements across platforms

2007-04-12 10:06  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "Adding back missing search paths in
	  FindOpenThreads.cmake. Also fixed
	  a bug regarding when to set the debug version. It waited until
	  both
	  include and library were set, but it shouldn't wait on include.
	  
	  Also added a fix to the optional warning flags."

2007-04-12 09:59  robert

	* Added SETUP_COMMANDLINE_APPLICATION and SETUP_COMMANDLINE_EXAMPLE
	  macros

2007-04-12 09:33  robert

	* From Eric Wing,
	  "Attached is a patch allows access access to the CMake
	  MACOSX_BUNDLE
	  option. Now SETUP_APPLICATION and SETUP_EXAMPLE take an
	  additional
	  optional parameter that specifies if the program is a command
	  line
	  application or a GUI application (think: IS_COMMANDLINE_APP).
	  Passing
	  1 means true (is_commandline_app). Passing 0 or omitting the
	  parameter
	  means false.
	  
	  I changed the scripts for osgversion and osgunittests to support
	  this
	  option because I believe they are command line apps. Are there
	  any
	  others?"

2007-04-12 09:32  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-04-12 09:32  robert

	* Changed the parameter handling so that it supports left to right
	  inheritance of settings

2007-04-11 11:20  robert

	* Added support for multiple colour layers, and fixed handling of
	  elevation
	  and colour layers having different locator

2007-04-11 08:35  robert

	* From Eric Wing,
	  "
	  Changes include:
	  
	  A internal cache flag that can be used to detect if this is the
	  first
	  time running the CMake configuration. This is needed to work
	  around
	  stupid CMake UI shortcomings about the UI not reflecting anything
	  you
	  SET unless you use FORCE. But if you use FORCE, you override
	  anything
	  the user may try to set/override unless you have an exception
	  check.
	  It turns out the exception check you need is often the first-run
	  check. This flag is potentially useful for other things too.
	  
	  An optional switch that turns on more aggressive warnings based
	  on
	  your compiler.
	  
	  Some Apple specific stuff for detecting the OS version and
	  enabling
	  Universal Binaries (and some additional compiler flags that are
	  good
	  but gcc version dependent). The version check code is
	  unfortunately
	  really fragile. I need to lobby CMake to return the OS X version
	  number for us. FYI, building Universal will fail with the current
	  CMake release due to a bug, but is now fixed in CVS.
	  "

2007-04-11 08:33  robert

	* Removed tabs

2007-04-10 11:03  robert

	* Create new incliude/osgViewer/api directory to hold platform

2007-04-06 15:13  robert

	* From Eric Wing, pedantic warning fixes

2007-04-06 14:40  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "I've added the code to set up quad_stereo
	  properly. I have tested with
	  WinXP / VC8, stereo is working. I also added code to set
	  sampleBuffers
	  and samples. These cannot yet be properly set, tested (windows
	  only ) by
	  changing _numMultiSamples in DisplaySettings::setDefaults() and
	  recompiling."

2007-04-06 14:38  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "1. Disable suppression of osg::CullStack.
	  I've been building the osgWrapper code successfully with this
	  change on both Windows and Linux, but I believe you said you got
	  some (unspecified) errors when you tried it before. If it still
	  causes problems, could you post the errors so I can try to solve
	  them?
	  
	  
	  
	  2. Change osg::GraphicsContext from object-type to
	  abstract-object-type. The current setting is incorrect because
	  the class is actually abstract."

2007-04-06 14:36  robert

	* From Laurens Voerman, "attached is
	  OpenSceneGraph\src\osgViewer\GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp
	  I've added the code to get the osgViewer working on windows
	  displays
	  with less than 32 bit color. Only tested with 16 bit color."

	  use of 16bit luminance format for colour layers used as input to
	  transfer functions

2007-04-04 09:07  robert

	* Added support for flushing buffer objects

2007-03-29 19:42  robert

	  it to be assigned as a vertex attribute array to an
	  osg::Geometry.

2007-03-28 08:43  robert

	* From Martin Aumueller, "in order to remove a dependency on Coin3D
	  (which is GPLed) and make it work
	  with SGI's OpenInventor, I had to change
	  OpenSceneGraph/src/osgPlugins/Inventor, as SoVRMLImageTexture is
	  not avaible
	  in SGI's Inventor. "
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, tweaked the above so that it uses Coin
	  headers to switch on coin features:
	  
	  #ifdef COIN_SOCALLBACKACTION_H
	  #define USE_COIN 1
	  #endif

2007-03-28 07:34  robert

	* From Luigi Calori, added Find3rdPartyDependencies.cmake

2007-03-27 21:44  robert

	* From Luigi Calori, "here is a patch to use Mike 3rdParty
	  dependencies
	  It should not be introusive to any other palatform apart MSVC,
	  but in order to link to debug-specific libs
	  I had to change plugins CMakeLists to differentiate debug/release
	  linkage, I have used the same macro used in core libs
	  Now the macro used for plugin and examples linking test for
	  existance of TARGET_LIBRARIES_VARS
	  that holds the names of the variables that have to be used for
	  linking"

	* Added Locator and layer setting to osgterrain example

2007-03-26 13:02  robert

	* From Luigi Calori, "when we link against something that comes out
	  from a Find... we ususally have a variable
	  <LINK_VAR_NAME>available like OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY,
	  so I' ve set up a macro that uses the variable name expanded for
	  linking, and test if a variable ${LINK_VAR_NAME}_DEBUG
	  like OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DEBUG exists and in case uses it for
	  linking in debug mode.
	  I' ve also set up FindOpenThreads to set up these variables.
	  I had to edit the core libraries CMakeLists to add the calls to
	  the macros used.
	  I' ve tested under MSVC"

2007-03-26 13:00  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "This is another weirdo change to support code
	  generation. It brings all the Drawable::supports and
	  Drawable::accepts overloads into the ShapeDrawable scope to avoid
	  errors invoking the ones that are not defined in ShapeDrawable.
	  Currently you'll get compilation errors if you pass a
	  Drawable::AttributeFunctor or PrimitiveIndexFunctor to the
	  "accept" function invoked on a ShapeDrawable pointer or
	  reference, since those overloads are only defined in the base
	  class. You'll also get the same error passing a
	  PrimitiveIndexFunctor to the "supports" function. These errors
	  occur because C++ function overload resolution does not cross
	  inheritance boundaries."

2007-03-26 09:48  robert

2007-03-23 17:37  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "This change fixes a couple bugs in the
	  osgIntrospection protected function support. I missed adding the
	  protected/public specifier on a couple recursive invocations, so
	  those functions are not currently returning protected functions
	  for base classes when they should."

	* Removed now redundent method

2007-03-16 14:28  robert

	* From David Callu, " bug:
	  Lost the functionality to find the real type pointed by a
	  pointer.
	  Ex: a osg::Node pointer point on a osg::Group, if I look for
	  information
	  on the pointer type, the introspection say it is a "osg::Node*".
	  But if I want information on the pointed type,
	  the introspection must return the "osg::Group".
	  
	  
	  This bug come from the
	  osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function.
	  In the original version, this function use the member
	  "Instance_base *inst_"
	  like this :
	  typeof(*static_cast<Instance<T> *>(inst_)->_data)
	  
	  But in the new version, this function use the template argument
	  "T":
	  typeof(typename remove_pointer<T>::type)
	  
	  This is a good meta-programming use, but here we need a dynamic
	  request.
	  
	  Moreover the "typeof" macro define in "Reflection" header accept
	  only a type in parameter with the new version.
	  
	  
	  
	  fix:
	  Add the macro "typeofvalue" in "Reflection" header which accept a
	  value or a type in parameter.
	  Restore original code in
	  osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function.

	  osg::Drawable::ConstAttributeFunctor, and
	  osg::StateAttribute::ModeUsage in osg and osgSim were not being
	  properly reflected in osgIntrospection. This appears to be due to
	  Doxygen not handling nested types from superclasses if they're
	  not qualified when referenced in subclasses.
	  
	  
	  
	  These changes add the necessary superclass type qualification so
	  that Doxygen now recognizes the references."

	* From Brede Johansen, Thanks for the model it helped to understand
	  the problem. In Creator the "Last Frame Duration" is performed on
	  the last frame of the last loop iteration, I tried to use it for
	  the last frame of every loop iteration. As you already have
	  explained we need a custom Sequence node. In the osgSim nodekit
	  we already have a couple of specialized nodes for the OpenFlight
	  format. We need an osgSim::GroupAnimation but I don't have the
	  time right now to take this challenge. Until then I have modified
	  my last attempt to work with the current osg::Sequence node by
	  ignoring the "Last Frame Duration".

2007-02-21 15:15  robert

	* Wojciech Lewandowski: "TexGenNode::TexGenNode( TexGen * texGen )
	  constructor does not initialize ReferenceFrame. I am not sure
	  maybe this was the intent but first constructor does it so I
	  don't see a reson why third one shouldn't."

2007-02-16 13:33  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "I added a bool to GraphicsContext::Traits to
	  indicate wether to use the
	  multithreaded-opengl-engine on os x or not. I set its default to

	  perhaps other os x users can test this setting with their
	  data/apps, to
	  see if we can enable it by default.
	  
	  I changed also the borderless-window-type, so expos?works

	  consistency I think that's the best solution."

2007-02-15 14:53  robert

	* Reorganised the text comments so that they are shorter length,
	  and hopefully will

	  I've changed line 196 from:
	  
	  viewport->layout.viewL=(Lib3dsView*)calloc(sizeof(Lib3dsView),views);
	  
	  to:
	  
	  viewport->layout.viewL= views ?

	  XCode-project.

	  - Use of respondsToSelector and instancesRespondToSelector to
	  demonstrate runtime feature checking to provide access to newer
	  features while still compiling on and supporting legacy versions
	  
	  The new file "Localizable.strings" needs to be placed inside the
	  English.lproj directory."

2007-02-13 13:47  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "Here is the next in the series of changes I'm
	  making to OSG introspection to support the attributes needed for
	  C# bindings. This change adds virtual/pure virtual attributes to
	  MethodInfo and an explicit attribute to ConstructorInfo using the
	  implementation strategy that David Callu recommended a few months
	  back (thanks David!). This change updates both genwrapper and
	  osgIntrospection, and assumes the osgIntrospection reference
	  support that's still pending in your submission queue."

2007-02-12 17:14  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "These changes add support for reflection of
	  reference and const reference type representations via
	  osgIntrospection::Type. This covers just the static type
	  information; the dynamic behavior via
	  Type::createInstance/Type::InvokeMethod should not be affected."

	  making the code more general purpose, and less reliant on classes
	  like osgUtil::SceneView and osgUtil::IntersectVisitor.

2007-02-11 15:42  robert

	* Added osgText to dependency of osgmanipualator example.

	  tweaks and rename for osgDragger to osgManipulator for build by
	  Robert Osfield.
	  Vivek's email to osg-submissions:
	  
	  "I'm happy to release the osgdragger nodekit to the OSG
	  community. I
	  implemented the nodekit for my company, Fugro-Jason Inc., and
	  they
	  have kindly agreed to open source it.
	  
	  The nodekit contains a few draggers but it should be easy to
	  build new
	  draggers on top of it. The design of the nodekit is based on a
	  SIGGRAPH 2002 course - "Design and Implementation of Direct
	  Manipulation in 3D". You can find the course notes at
	  http://www.pauliface.com/Sigg02/index.html. Reading pages 20 - 29
	  of
	  the course notes should give you a fair understanding of how the
	  nodekit works.
	  
	  The source code also contains an example of how to use the
	  draggers."

2007-02-10 18:01  robert

	* From Vivek Rajan, MatrixDecomposition implementaion, adapted by
	  Robert Osfield
	  to be part of osg::Matrixf and osg::Matrixd classes.

2007-02-09 21:31  robert

	  for its
	  shadow implementation

2007-02-09 16:31  robert

	* From Carlo Camporesi, "In attach there is a little bug fix to net

	  "

2007-02-09 16:27  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2007-02-09 16:03  robert

	* Moved the basic ShadowVolume code into osgShadow

2007-02-09 14:54  robert

	* From Yefei He, " I wrote a class derived from CopyOp that
	  preserves the multi-parent
	  structure of scene graphs. I only considered the case of
	  DEEP_COPY_NODES,
	  but it is sufficient for me. It is not the most elegant way -- I
	  used
	  a map to list all the already cloned nodes with multiple parents,
	  to be
	  looked up whenever such a node is revisited. The good part is, it
	  works."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, fixed build problems under Linux 64 due to
	  use of int's to store Node*
	  in internal maps used in above custom CopyOp. Added ref_ptr<>
	  usage to main to
	  prevent memory leaks

2007-02-09 14:35  robert

	* From Joakim Simmonsson, fixed inconsistent newlines

2007-02-09 14:21  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "Make DelaunayTriangulator less verbose - It was

	  it to INFO to make it less verbose."

2007-02-09 13:51  robert

	* Changed GraphicsWindowX11 so that it creates two Display*
	  connextions to the Xserver,
	  one for the graphics thread, one for the main thread that
	  querries events

2007-02-09 13:36  robert

	* Added #if #else #endif blocks to Viewer::realize() and run() for

2007-02-09 12:08  robert

	* Removed debug message

2007-02-08 22:36  robert

	* From André Garneau, "Attached is a fix for the hang occuring on
	  Win32 when the thread model is changed.
	  
	  The issue was caused by the mutex in the
	  ViewerDoubleBufferRenderingOperation being released even though
	  they were not owned. This was causing the underlying critical
	  section object lock count values becoming negative; the next time
	  the lock was acquired it would block because of that."

2007-02-08 22:31  robert

	* From Brian Keener, fixes for Cygwin filename handling

2007-02-08 20:30  robert

	* From Charles Cole, "The program database filename was changed for
	  the osgviewer application such
	  as to not conflict with the program database file generated by
	  the core
	  osgViewer library. This change allows for both the application
	  and library
	  to be used in debugging mode within Visual Studio. This change
	  has been
	  tested with Visual Studio 2005 (VS8)."

2007-02-08 20:27  robert

	* Updated wrappers

	* Added setting of the DatabasePager's affinity.

2007-02-08 10:46  robert

	* From Donn Mielcarek, "We generated some bad ive files in our
	  database. In
	  some of the files, the function readInt() would return
	  a 0 size. While linux will happily continue on,
	  creating 0 sized arrays, Windows immediately
	  blows up, with sparks sometimes flying out the

	  To set up extension aliases using a config file, an app calls:

	  be done before loading any files whose names depend on the
	  mapping.) osgDB will search for the file using OSG_FILE_PATH.
	  
	  The file should contain a line for each mapping, with the "map"
	  extension first, followed by a space or tab, then the plugin

2007-02-02 12:41  robert

	* Added a concrete osg::DeleteHandler implementation which provides

2007-01-28 09:17  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, "This file removes the virtual destructor of
	  osgText::String. It seemed wrong that osgText::String should have
	  a vtable since it is treated like a value type, and any

	  anomaly when classifying the OSG types for C# bindings."

2007-01-27 17:57  robert

	* From André Garneau, "
	  
	  
	  
	  * Setup proper pixel format for ATI boards (removal of
	  WGL_SWAP_METHOD_ARB specification from the requested pixel format
	  since unsupported by the ATI driver)
	  
	  * Fix to create sample OpenGL window on the proper display
	  device. This is the temporary window used to choose the desired
	  pixel format. In the previous version, this window was always
	  created on the primary display device, even though it had
	  potentially different pixel formats compared to the target
	  display device containing the window to be created.
	  
	  * Implementation of
	  WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenResolution() method
	  
	  * Implementation of
	  WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenRefreshRate() method
	  
	  * Implementation of GraphicsWindow::requestWarpPointer() method
	  
	  * Implementation of GraphicsWindow::useCursor() method and
	  associated trait support. This can be used in two ways; first,
	  when the graphics trait requested indicates that no cursor should
	  be present, a new cursor-less window class is used to create the
	  window. When a cursor-enabled window creation is requested,
	  another window class is used. After creation of a window, it is
	  also possible to toggle the cursor state by using the
	  GraphicsWindow::useCursor method.
	  
	  * The way the mouse behaves is now compatible with the behaviour
	  seen on X11; i.e. when pressing a mouse button, the window where
	  the pointer is located will capture the mouse input and release
	  it only after the button has been released. This results in all
	  mouse movement events being dispatched to the window where the
	  button was pressed initially until it is released. This improves
	  the interaction with graphics windows.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Preparation work has been done to support the ability of moving
	  a window from one screen to another screen and recreating its
	  rendering context when this happens. This has been tested with a
	  mix of NVIDIA and ATI cards and works properly. For the moment
	  being, this feature is commented out due to changes in the core
	  OSG libraries that have been done but need to be submitted later
	  this week for approval by Robert.
	  
	  
	  
	  Upcoming features
	  
	  
	  
	  * Support for moving windows from one screen to another screen
	  seamlessly
	  
	  
	  
	  * Ability to set the window (i.e. the application itself creates
	  the rendering window and passes it to the GraphicsWindowWin32
	  class)
	  
	  
	  
	  * Other miscellaneous items"

2007-01-15 10:11  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "The OpenFlight loader already have a
	  caching mechanism for externals.
	  The cache works for nested externals but is cleared before the
	  master
	  flight file is returned. I implemented texture caching using the
	  same
	  mechanism."

2007-01-15 09:56  robert

	* From Paul Martz and Geoff Michel, Paul updated Geoff's bug fixes

2007-01-12 22:07  robert

	* From Riccardo Corsi, "this should be the final version of the
	  qt-plugin ported to windows and cleaned up to avoid crashes on
	  exit.
	  Stephan and I tested it on Mac and Win.
	  Just a couple of notes:
	  
	  * the plugin is able to load both regular 2D images and movie
	  stream. There is a #define QT_HANDLE_IMAGES_ALSO mechanism to
	  indicate whether to use it for images or not. This is defined by
	  default on Mac only, to avoid conflicts with the standard windows
	  plugins. See comments on QTUtils.h
	  
	  * de-initialization of quicktime before exit is now left to an
	  observer, which calls exitQuicktime() when last media loaded with
	  the plugin is released. This prevent a crash on exit without need
	  of any extra call external to the plugin."

2007-01-12 22:01  robert

	* Added explicit to ParticleEffect constructors

2007-01-12 21:44  robert

	* From Tom Jolley, "There was some unnecessary creation and
	  deletion of Particle objects in
	  include/osgParticle/ParticleSystem. I replaced
	  
	  Particle(ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp)
	  
	  with
	  
	  ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp
	  
	  in a couple of places. This should make particle creation and
	  reuse go
	  a little faster without all that memory allocation and copying."

2007-01-12 21:33  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "New features:
	  + Multi-display-support
	  + automatic hiding of the menubar/dock if one of the windows
	  intersects
	  the menubar/dock
	  
	  Bugfixes:
	  + event-handling was done by the first opened window, other
	  windows did
	  not receive events -- fixed
	  + mouse-coordinates were absolute, now they are relative to the
	  window.
	  
	  known bugs:
	  + windows with decoration and in fullscreen-size are moved by the
	  system
	  a little bit, so that the titlebar is accessible/visible. So if
	  you want
	  real fullscreen-windows, don't decorate the window :)
	  
	  I updated the XCode-project-file so all ported examples are
	  linked
	  against osgViewer."

	  based .wrl/VRML plugin

2007-01-09 11:42  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, "New delaunay triangulator attached. I hadn't
	  realised that the erase() method was not erase (first, last) but
	  erase (first, one after the last one you want deleted). This made
	  a big difference; however some of the edges of the terrain were
	  not included as edges in the terrain so I increased the size of
	  the supertriangle, which works but reduces accuracy due to the
	  larger range of coordinates in the supertriangle. (A larger
	  supertriangle forces the triangles using supertriangle vertices
	  to be long and thin, making the triangulation fit the convex hull
	  of the terrain.)
	  
	  The loss of accuracy should not affect 'normal' users with
	  terrains that are roughly square (say up to 100:1 aspect ratio)
	  and where the Z range is comparable to the X-Y range. Retested
	  with Pauls data, amalric's strange polygon constraint and the
	  standard test constraints.
	  
	  I also added 2 tests for routines with a NULL argument passed to
	  them (no-one would usually pass a NULL pointer to these routines
	  unless - as I did in testing- you remove some of the constraints
	  but still pass their pointer to the routine). And I removed 3
	  tests for triangles which are already removed when generating the
	  geometry.
	  
	  NB Paul - the previous delaunay triangulator fails under VS8 IF
	  it has any constraints as it attempts to use some vertices that
	  have already been deleted when applying the constraints to edges.
	  Under VS6 and less rigorous compilers it works as the deleted
	  vertices are still in the points stl::Vector; however any added
	  vertices would replace one of the supertriangle vertices with
	  non-disastrous but wrong results."
	  
	  Note, merged with latest name changes in CVS.

	* Improved handling of window input ranges for single window apps

2006-12-27 16:44  robert

	* Removed old hack to disable multi-threaded cameras when particle

	  this is no longer required as osgParticle has now been made
	  thread safe.

2006-12-27 16:40  robert

	* Added an osgDB::ReadWriteMutex to help manage the ability to have

	* Replaced the osgProducer dependencies by osgViewer for osgcatch
	  and osghangglide examples

2006-12-27 15:04  robert

	  forward and implement.

2006-12-26 20:26  robert

	* Ported osghangglider example to usg osgViewer

	* Ported osgcatch to use osgViewer

2006-12-24 16:40  robert

	* Unified the osg::GraphicsThread::Operation and
	  osg::GraphicsContext::Operation classes
	  as osg::GraphicsOperation. Unpdated parts of OSG depending upon
	  these.
	  
	  Added a virtaul bool valid() method to osg::GraphicsContext to
	  allow apps to
	  test whether a valid graphis context has been created or not.

2006-12-22 21:53  robert

	* Added support for sample and sampleBuffers to
	  osg::GraphicsContext::Traits and
	  cleaned up the Traits naming

	  Updated osgcamera example to use new Viewer API calls instead of
	  using local
	  rendering calls.

2006-12-21 12:24  robert

	* Cleaned up the includes in the GraphicsWindowX11 header

2006-12-21 12:19  robert

	* Moved the implementation of GraphicsWindowX11 from the head into
	  the src/osgViewer directory.

2006-12-21 11:20  robert

	  complained to me about them since I posted them on the users list
	  last week."

2006-12-19 17:30  robert

	* From Mathias Fröhlich, "I have a small update to the 'non convex
	  polygon detection' in the ac3d loader
	  that is used to tell if tesselation is required or if we will
	  better leave a
	  polygon as is. It is still not perfect but catches some more
	  cases."

2006-12-19 17:16  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "minor code comment cleaup/rewording"

2006-12-19 17:06  robert

	* Added support WindowingSystemInterface for querring the number of
	  screens, the screen size and creating GraphicsContexts.

2006-12-15 17:27  robert

	* Added ViewPoint support into

2006-12-14 21:15  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "New option "cloneExternalReferences" for
	  OpenFlight plugin"

2006-12-14 16:13  robert

	* From Orhun Birsoy, "In SimpleViewer::frameUpdateTraversal
	  function, orthographicCamera calculation has some typos. It
	  should read
	  bool orthographicCamera = (pm(0,3)==0.0) && (pm(1,3)==0.0) &&

	  to add -O "plugin options",
	  some fix to osgdem.cpp and osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp
	  
	  These mods should allow to build terrains controlling jpeg
	  compressed
	  imagery embedded in ive files, using something like:
	  
	  osgdemd --image-ext jpeg --RGB_24 -O "JPEG_QUALITY 20
	  compressImageData" ......."

2006-12-07 10:09  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, "I was getting triangulations with the
	  previous delaunay triangulator, but it seems I may have been
	  picking up the wrong coordinates or an old version of my test
	  file (that version is OK when no coordinates lie outside the
	  'terrain' zone). This version is much stricter about memory
	  handling and insertion of extra points."

2006-12-06 21:39  robert

	* From Gerrick Bivins, fixed newly introduced texture setup bug.

2006-12-06 21:29  robert

	* From Riccardo Corsi, add VS6.0 project file for new quicktime
	  windows port

2006-12-06 14:17  robert

	* From Rick Pingry, "n my application I am walking through the
	  scene graph looking for nodes of a specific name. I noticed there
	  were times when some of the nodes were not named what I had
	  expected. Upon reviewing the code, I noticed this was happening
	  when there was a forward reference to a parented object.
	  
	  The existing code uses a map with object ID's. The original code
	  only applied the name to a node for a new ID only if the node did
	  not already exist in the map. The problem was that there was
	  another part of the code (when a parent was forward declared)
	  that also created the node with the ID in the map, but it did not
	  know its name. I simply made sure that the name was set
	  regardless of whether or not the node was already in the map. "

2006-12-05 22:10  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-12-05 20:30  robert

	* Checked in remaining element from Brede Johansen changes for
	  clmapToEdge reader option.

2006-12-05 17:30  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "minor bugfixes for the quicktime-plugin"

2006-12-05 17:27  robert

	* From Gerrick Bivins, "Changes:
	  --merged with fixes for texture coordinates(is this in CVS/SVN
	  already)?
	  --changed above mentioned fix output level from osg::NOTIFY to
	  osg::DEBUG_INFO
	  --added support for VRML97 ImageTextures.
	  --changed pointers to ref_pointers where possible.
	  --added format (method separated by "//////") for easier
	  reading."

2006-12-05 17:10  robert

	* From Roger James,"I have had another go at the windows specific
	  file name handling in daeWMaterials.cpp. I think I have arrived
	  at a temporary compromise.
	  
	  I have decided to just normalise the drive letter part of file
	  names for the time being and also ensure that names of the format
	  x:/xxxxx are treated as absolute paths. This will cover a lot of
	  cases.
	  
	  I have raised a bug against collada which hopefully should
	  resolve some others. However there are some pathological cases
	  which I have commented on in the code, these will probably never
	  work properly unless there is a significant rewrite of the daeURI
	  functionality. Hopefully they are rare."

2006-12-05 16:45  robert

	* From Rein Kadijk, "While displaying a certain scene, OsgEdit
	  crashed in ProxyNode::traverse() in file
	  OSG_OP_OT-1.2\OpenSceneGraph\src\osg\proxynode.cpp.
	  It turned out that nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler() returned NULL;
	  using this pointer to call one of DatabaseRequestHandler's
	  methods is of course illegal.
	  I patched it by adding: if (nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler())"
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, reordered the addition of the
	  nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler() check to allow the
	  default traverse() to be called when no database handling is
	  attached to the visitor.

2006-12-05 16:29  robert

	* From Stephan Huber and Riccardo Corsi, port of QuickTime plugin
	  to Windows

2006-12-05 15:41  robert

	* Added use of typedef to help clean up the readability a little
	  and replaced a copy list with a reference.

2006-12-05 15:31  robert

	* From Sylvain Marie, "changed raw pointers to smart pointers in
	  the dxfBlock, dxfTables and
	  dxfSection classes, so their members data are correctly deleted.
	  - changed some methods signatures to pass arguments by reference
	  instead of
	  by value. The performance and memory usage are enhanced (the
	  reader was
	  clogging the heap when reading some large DXF files)
	  
	  The updated files have been compiled and tested with a variety of
	  DXF files
	  on XP with VS2003, but the changes should not disturb any other
	  compiler."

2006-12-05 14:58  robert

	* From Chris McGlone, "PlygonZ copy constructor: added allocation
	  and copying of zarray"

2006-12-05 14:50  robert

	* From Bryan Thrall, "Currently, the DatabasePager always loads
	  requested Nodes using the
	  default Registry Options object, but it would be useful to be
	  able to
	  request loading with a different Options object. The attached
	  files
	  allow you to do that (based off the OSG 1.2 source).
	  
	  For example, I'm implementing a loader that requires context
	  information
	  when it pages in subgraphs, which becomes significantly
	  complicated when
	  multiple scenegraphs are requesting subgraph loads with different
	  contexts (the loader needs to know which context to use, and the
	  Registry Options needs to be carefully managed so the context
	  settings
	  don't clobber each other, especially in multithreaded
	  situations). Being
	  able to pass an Options instance along with the Node request
	  resolves
	  this problem."

2006-12-05 14:28  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "added a new reader option to replace the
	  texture
	  wrap mode CLAMP with CLAMP_TO_EDGE."

	  in the plane intersections routines

2006-12-04 17:31  robert

	* Improved the calculation of distance around the globe within the
	  ElevationSlice routine.

2006-12-04 12:36  robert

	* Added preliminary support for generating distance, height lists
	  for ElevationSlice.

2006-11-30 18:42  robert

	* Fixed typo and updated wrappers

2006-11-30 18:33  robert

	* Improved the edge normal computation

2006-11-30 16:55  robert

	* Checked in new .plists'

2006-11-30 16:30  robert

	* Basic shadow volume alogirthm implemented in example.

2006-11-30 12:05  robert

	* Added dynamic updating of light position and multi-pass addition
	  of ambient and diffuse lighting

2006-11-30 12:04  robert

	* Fixed shadow volume geometry handling of direcitonal lights

2006-11-30 10:29  robert

	* Added movement of the light source to test performance of update
	  the shadow volumes

2006-11-29 22:00  robert

	* Added handling of loops

2006-11-29 21:43  robert

	* Added plane to triangle intersections and segment combining, work
	  still not complete though.

2006-11-29 20:10  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, added support for writing 16-bit rgb images

2006-11-29 14:33  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-29 14:21  robert

	* Further work on PlaneIntersector

2006-11-29 11:00  robert

	* Added dummy virtual method implementations

2006-11-29 10:51  robert

	* Cleaned up inheritance

2006-11-29 09:18  robert

	* Ran unix2dos to get rid of unix line ending

2006-11-28 20:45  robert

	* Removed redundent wrapper

2006-11-28 16:49  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-28 16:30  robert

	* Moved osgUtil::PolytopeIntersector, osgUtil::PlaneIntersector and
	  osgUtil::LineSegmentIntersector out from
	  include/osgUtil/IntersecionVisitor into their own seperate files.

2006-11-28 16:00  robert

	* Added support for float or double osg::Plane, and the default
	  osg::Plane to double.
	  Performance tests on big models did not indicate any performance
	  penalty in using doubles over floats,
	  so the move to doubles should mainly impact precision
	  improvements for whole earth databases.
	  
	  Also made improvements to osgUtil::PlaneIntersector and
	  osgSim::ElevationSlice classes

2006-11-28 11:10  robert

	* Fixed fade text memory consumption bug which was due to new
	  RenderInfo being
	  created local to RenderStage and passed on to rendering code
	  which populated
	  the RenderInfo UserData, but without the restoring the new
	  UserData to the
	  main RenderInfo. The local RenderInfo UserData is now passed back
	  to the main
	  RenderInfo.

2006-11-28 10:31  robert

	* Removed the now redundent dateUtils.h file.

2006-11-28 09:14  robert

	* Added missing Camera.h and removed redundent CameraNode.h

2006-11-27 20:25  robert

	* Added beginnings of osgUtil::PlaneIntersector and
	  osgSim::ElevationSlice

2006-11-27 16:25  robert

	* Added QWidget style constructor parameters

2006-11-27 14:52  robert

	* Renamed osg::CameraNode to osg::Camera, cleaned up osg::View.
	  
	  Added beginnings of new
	  osgViewer::Scene,View,Viewer,CompositeViewer and
	  GraphicsWindowProxy files.

2006-11-27 11:25  robert

	* From Mauricio Hofmam, added support for reading images from all
	  osg::CameraNode attachments in RenderStage.

2006-11-27 09:23  robert

	* From André Garneau, "The file submitted includes a fix to
	  properly support DDS textures compressed under the DXT-1 format
	  when they contain alpha information.
	  
	  Under this mode, each 4x4 texel block can selectively use an
	  alpha component or none. When alpha-enabled blocks are present,
	  this is not reported in the DDPF_ALPHAPIXELS bit in the pixel
	  format flags causing the reader-writer to report the file as a
	  3-components file (GL_COMPRESSED_RGB_S3TC_DXT1_EXT). The fix
	  requires looking at each 4x4 texel block to detect the presence
	  of 1-bit alpha encoding. When such a block is found, the internal
	  & pixel formats are reported as GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT
	  instead.
	  
	  
	  
	  See
	  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/Opaque_and_1_Bit_Alpha_Textures.asp
	  for more information."

2006-11-26 22:27  robert

	* Removed check from objectDeleted(void*) method as this was not
	  catching cases
	  where the registered ptr was different from the deleted ptr -
	  something that
	  can happen with multiple inheritance.

2006-11-26 14:17  robert

	* Missed check of changes to the RemoveRedundentNodesVisitor

2006-11-24 21:19  robert

	* Added extra checks to RemoveRedendentVisitor to catch Groups that
	  may
	  only have one child, but also have StateSet's etc and thefore not
	  suitable
	  for removal.

2006-11-24 21:10  robert

	* Added isIdentity() method

2006-11-24 17:20  robert

	* Improved handling of bounding polytope

2006-11-24 11:37  robert

	* Added support for positional lights into
	  computeShadowVolumeGeometry code and cleaned up OccluderGeometry
	  interface.

2006-11-23 21:32  robert

	* Improved the ShadowVolumeGeometry orientations.

2006-11-23 17:29  robert

2006-11-23 11:22  robert

	* Added basic silhoette detection

2006-11-22 21:11  robert

	* From Roger James, "fixes mostly related to texture handling."

2006-11-22 21:09  robert

	* From Paul Martz, add OSG_FILE_PATH to end of setting of
	  OSG_FILE_PATH to preserve any previous settings

2006-11-22 20:52  robert

	* From Paul de Repentigny, "When calling osgdem with argument
	  "--image-ext", the application just
	  returns after loading the proper ReaderWriter for the given
	  extension." Fix was to remove the erroenous return.

2006-11-22 20:47  robert

	* From Sylvan Marie, "I attached my revised dxfEntity.cpp file from
	  the DXF plugin with the 2
	  following improvements:
	  
	  - When all unsupported entities (SOLIDS, TEXT, ...) have been
	  filtered out
	  from a block, dxfInsert::drawScene() was crashing because it
	  assumed that
	  the block was not empty. It now returns silently so the other
	  blocks can
	  still be imported.
	  
	  - The DXF reader assumed all vertices were read first, then the
	  face
	  indices. But, from the DXF "documentation" (www.autodesk.com/dxf)
	  :
	  "Polyface meshes created with the PFACE command are always
	  generated with
	  all the vertex coordinate entities first, followed by the face
	  definition
	  entities. The code within AutoCAD that processes polyface meshes
	  requires
	  this ordering. Programs that generate polyface meshes in DXF
	  should generate
	  all the vertices then all the faces. However, programs that read
	  polyface
	  meshes from DXF should be tolerant of odd vertex and face
	  ordering."
	  So now the importer ignores the posted number of vertices and
	  face indices,
	  and uses the size of the lists instead."

2006-11-22 20:39  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, Added missing initialization of the

	* Added removeDuplicates function

2006-11-21 16:15  robert

	  svn naming collision problems under Windows due t
	  osgviewer/osgViewer case insentive file name collisions.

2006-11-20 21:48  robert

	* Added nested files

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-14 16:59  robert

	* From Eric Wing, add use of the autodetection of windowing size
	  support in SDL-version 1.2.10 and later.
	  From Robert Osfield, made the above an optional compile as it
	  breaks apps based on previous version of SDL.

2006-11-14 16:37  robert

	* From Mathias Froehlich, "Improovments:
	  - does proper edge detection with the crease angle given in the
	  ac file
	  - the reader is much more verbose in case of broken files
	  - no more static variables
	  - std::stream based
	  - much faster, up to a factor of 50 for a polygonal test model
	  - if the file contains polygonal surfaces the loaded geometry is
	  still
	  polygonal as long as the polygons are convex. Concave polygons
	  are still
	  tesselated. Rationale: If the user needs triangular models he can
	  throw away
	  that extra information with the osgUtil::Optimizer himself. But
	  the read step
	  preserves as much extra information that is contained in the file
	  as
	  possible. Also the polygonal models look a bit smoother than the
	  triangular
	  ones.
	  - a huge cleanup
	  - the basic parsing logic from the original ac3d developer is
	  untouched
	  - the writer part is untouched
	  
	  The tarball contains a replacement for the src/osgPlugins/ac3d
	  directory that
	  is based on the current CVS (2006-11-13).
	  I have tested that loader with a osgconv foo.ac /tmp/xx.ive on
	  everyfoo. ac
	  file I could find (~200 from flightgear and the object database).
	  I also run
	  my flightgear development with that loader -> here I see the
	  models.
	  I run valgrind testcases on some selected models."

2006-11-14 15:06  robert

	* Added osgViewer depdendency to osgintersection, osgGLUT* examples

2006-11-14 12:55  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "I ran though the sample data that Gert
	  provided earlier today and tracked down the problem. The xoffset
	  in readHeightField and readImage were being applied even in
	  projected coordinate systems. This patch should fix the issue."

2006-11-14 12:51  robert

	* Further migration to using RenderInfo

2006-11-14 12:49  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, Follows is required to prevent unidented
	  cloning of shared arrays :
	  "I added some calls to isOperationPermissibleForObject() so I can
	  permit the flattten-pass with my specialized objects in my own
	  code."

2006-11-14 12:29  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "This patch adds a CoordOriginMode to the
	  osg::PointSprite attribute.
	  The mode needs to be changed to LOWER_LEFT when rendering point
	  sprites to pbuffers or FBOs, otherwise the points will be
	  transformed
	  on the CPU."

2006-11-14 12:16  robert

	* Added support for handling osg::ShapeDrawable style drawables in
	  OccluderGeoemtry.

2006-11-14 09:54  robert

	* Added check against null SceneData to prevent crash with empty

	* Added better handling of writeNode operations that arn't
	  successful.

2006-11-07 17:00  robert

	* Fixed the writeNode function so it was properly return
	  FILE_NOT_HANDLED, fixing
	  a big with it writing out an empty .flt file.

2006-11-07 14:26  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-11-07 13:48  robert

	* Ben van Basten, "1 Bug fix in reuseParticle where originally an
	  old particle that was already killed would be killed again, but
	  instead should have been placed on the dead stack for future
	  reuse.
	  
	  2 Getter/setter for _maxNumberOfParticlesToSkip that is used for
	  filtering of particles during draw. This enables you to turn the
	  filtering of by setting this value to zero.
	  
	  3 Getter for retrieval of the first particle in the trail. This
	  allows you to directly manipulate the trail from your application
	  by walking from the start particle towards the end of the trail."
	  
	  Submitted on Ben's behalf by Roland Smeenk.

2006-11-07 13:43  robert

2006-11-06 13:22  robert

	* Thanks to Björn Hein for spotting mistakes in EventQueue.cpp and
	  StateSetManipulator, now fixed by Robert Osfield. Problems were:
	  
	  "StateSetManipulator.cpp (rev 1.12, l. 85): cyclePolygonMode() is
	  called but
	  no aa.requestRedraw() afterwards. Is this intended?
	  
	  EventQueue.cpp (rev 1.8): in keyRelease & keyPressed KEY_Alt_R
	  was mapped to
	  MODKEY_LEFT_ALT"

2006-10-30 12:39  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-10-30 12:28  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix to get the proper normals
	  on an md2 model, actually
	  the way it was before would sometimes lead to a crash since it
	  was
	  attaching the wrong array to the geometry..."

2006-10-30 12:23  robert

	* From Vladimir Shabanov, "The DDS plugin didn't correctly read
	  mipmapped A8L8 textures.
	  I've attached a small fix for this.
	  
	  Cause: uncompressed mipmap handling was done only for RGB pixel
	  format.
	  
	  Fix: added condition for handling alpha and luminance formats
	  too."

2006-10-30 12:19  robert

	* From Michael Henheffer, "There's a problem with OverlayNodes
	  where the texture will not display
	  if continuous updating is set to false.
	  
	  The problem was being caused by the camera update call never
	  being made
	  if continuous updating was not set to true. This fix adds a flag
	  that
	  is set when dirtyOverlayTexture() is called and checked in the
	  update
	  visitor section of the traversal to determine if the camera
	  should be
	  updated.
	  
	  I tested the fix by making some changes to the osgAnimate example
	  program so it has continuous updating off and calls
	  dirtyOverlayTexture
	  for each frame. The overlay texture now displays properly."

2006-10-30 12:14  robert

	* From Edgar Ellis, "
	  method may not take the node into consideration when computing
	  its bound.
	  
	  In this case of:
	  switch->insertChild(0, child, false);
	  switch->insertChild(1, child, true);
	  
	  child will not be used in computeBound, but will be drawn.
	  
	  Solution:
	  Changed compute bound to loop over children using an index
	  instead of an
	  iterator. This behaviour matches that of the traverse method."
	  
	  -----------------------------------------------

2006-10-30 12:05  robert

	* From Michael Henheffer, "Bug: The reader would crash when trying
	  to load a .tif image that
	  contained an 8-bit color map. The crash occured at line 545:
	  
	  remap_row(currPtr, inbuf, w, red, green, blue);
	  
	  
	  Cause: The code was trying to write past the end of the buffer
	  while
	  doing this remapping. The size of the buffer is determined based
	  on the
	  value of 'format', which was 1 in this case since bitspersample
	  is
	  8(indicating a 8-bit color map). The buffer should have been
	  created 3
	  times as large since that 8-bit value is indexing a 24-bit color.
	  
	  
	  Fix: I've put in an if statement to set format to 3 if
	  'photometric'
	  indicates the tif contains a palette as the output data will
	  always be
	  24-bit color data in this case."

2006-10-30 11:55  robert

	* Fixed OSX x86 endian issue in Quicktime movie plugin.

2006-10-17 15:17  robert

	* From David Callu:
	  
	  "
	  the main problem is the wrapper generation:
	  The PropertyInfo class use MethodInfo class to access to the
	  value.
	  When the property are define with the I_Property* macro,
	  the MethodInfo use by the property to have access to the value
	  are instancied in the I_Property* macro, but there
	  are already instantied by the I_Method* macro before
	  
	  
	  secondary problem:
	  - the function used by the property could no be customized
	  in the genwrapper.conf file
	  - an array property can't insert a value
	  - the std::map reflector (and indexedProperty in general) haven't
	  remove method
	  - about the help in wrapper ... why not ...
	  
	  
	  
	  solution :
	  To use the function define by the I_Method, I add a MethodInfo
	  variable in the I_Method0 macro
	  old macro :
	  #define I_Method0(ret, fn) (\
	  params.clear(),\
	  addMethod(new osgIntrospection::TypedMethodIn
	  fo0<reflected_type, ret >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn,
	  params)))
	  
	  new macro :
	  #define I_Method0(ret, fn, signature, briefHelp, detailedHelp) \
	  params.clear(); \
	  osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature = addMethod(new
	  osgIntrospection::TypedMethodInfo0<reflected_type, ret
	  >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn, params, briefHelp,
	  detailedHelp)); sink(signature)
	  
	  
	  
	  the osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature is used by the
	  I_Property macro to define the MethodInfo that it use
	  
	  so for I_Property macro :
	  old macro :
	  #define I_PropertyWithReturnType(t, n, r) \
	  cap=addProperty(new
	  osgIntrospection::PropertyInfo(osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(reflected_type)),
	  osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(t)), #n, \
	  I_Method0(t, get##n), \
	  I_Method1(r, set##n, IN, t, value)))
	  
	  new macro:
	  #define I_SimpleProperty(t, n, get, set) \
	  get, \
	  set))
	  
	  The genwrapper has been modified in this way.
	  The method signature is define by the prototype of the method
	  For example, the "const char* libraryName();" have
	  "__C5_char_P1__libraryName" for signature
	  
	  
	  solution for secondary problem:
	  The genwrapper accept new tokens in the configuration to
	  custumize the property.
	  The new PropertyInserter and the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute
	  class has been defined
	  The PropertyRemover has been added to the StdMapReflector
	  The _briefHelp and _detailedHelp variable has been added in
	  PropertyInfo, MethodInfo and ContructorInfo class
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  modification:
	  
	  I have modify the genwrapper files
	  Configuration.cpp Configuration.h add some tokens to custumize
	  the property
	  Doxyfile.template add the comment in the output xml
	  genwrapper.conf customize some property in osg::Geometry
	  RegistryBuilder.h RegistryBuilder.cpp add the process_help
	  function (to extract help from xml)
	  TypeRegister.cpp TypeRegister.h optimize the property detection
	  TypeDesc.h TypeDesc.cpp modify FunctionDesc and PropertyDesc
	  WrapperGenerator.h WrapperGenerator.cpp modify the output
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  I also modify the fallowing osgIntrospection files:
	  
	  include/osgIntrospection/Attributes add the PropertyInserter and
	  the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute class
	  include/osgIntrospection/ConstructorInfo add the _briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp variable in the ConstructorInfo class
	  add access function for the two new variables (_briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp)
	  modify the constructor to define the two new variables
	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/MethodInfo add the _briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp variable in the MethodInfo class
	  add access function for the two new variables (_briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp)
	  modify the constructor to define the two new variables
	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/PropertyInfo add the _briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp variable in the PropertyInfo class
	  add access function for the two new variables (_briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp)
	  modify the constructor to define the two new variables
	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/ReflectionMacro remove unused
	  I_Property* macro
	  modify all I_Method macro to accept the help string

	* Ported across to using GraphicsWindow.

2006-10-14 21:50  robert

	* From Chuck Seberion, added support reading ARB float format
	  textures.

	* From Terry Welsh, mplemented POINT_ROT_EYE.

2006-10-14 10:16  robert

	* From Paul de Repentigny, fix for dvide by zero crash under
	  windows when toggle full screen in ogviewer.
	  From Robert Osfield, tweak to the fix to add comment describing
	  the extra check, and addition of check against width, and change
	  to ==0 rather than <= 0.

2006-10-14 10:07  robert

	* Fixed texture coordinates of cylinder ends.

2006-10-13 14:00  robert

2006-10-06 14:46  robert

	* Fixed OSGSHADOW_LIBRARY define

2006-10-06 14:45  robert

	* Fixed library name

2006-10-06 14:16  robert

	* First cut at class interfaces and stubs for implementations for
	  the new osgShadow NodeKit

2006-10-06 13:04  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "Here's a patch discussed in the thread
	  "OpenFlight Loader Discarding
	  Material" on the osg-user mailing list."

2006-10-06 11:02  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-10-06 09:54  robert

	* Removed osgGA::GUIEventHandlerVisitor and osgGA::SetSceneVistor
	  classes/headers as
	  this classes weren't being actively used the distribution,
	  effectively being noops.

2006-10-06 06:58  robert

	* Added workaround for NVidia driver bug into SceneView::init() to
	  prevent the extensions
	  string being initialized within a display list.

2006-10-05 14:32  robert

	* Removed deprecated GUIEventHandler method

2006-10-05 10:59  robert

	* Renamed variable

2006-10-05 10:59  robert

	* Refactored osgsimpleviewerQT4 to implement a GraphicsWindowQT,
	  and then use
	  multiple inheritance to build the final SimpleViewerQT.

2006-10-05 10:07  robert

	* Added a path with an experiemental GraphicsContexProducer
	  implementation, and a
	  test of mulitple inheritance.

2006-10-05 10:06  robert

	* Added osgGA::GraphicsWindow base class that derives from
	  osg::GraphicsContext but
	  adds default overrides its pure virtue methods, and an
	  EventQueue.

2006-10-04 09:11  robert

	* Added osgGA depedency.

2006-10-03 20:42  robert

	* Removed the redundent relaseGLObjects() method declerations

2006-10-03 20:20  robert

	* From John Aughey, "Attached is the Optimizer.cpp file that has
	  the fix to duplicate vertex and normal arrays if there is more
	  than one reference to the data. This fixes the problem where the
	  transforms are applied to the same vertex array multiple times if
	  that vertex array is re-used within the model. "

2006-10-03 19:55  robert

	* From John Aughey, "The id name of nodes are not being set in the
	  daeReader::processNode method. The names are retained in most of
	  the other osg::Nodes that are created. In this case, I have an
	  external modeler creating models, and the name of component nodes
	  are used to give that subtree different characteristics."

2006-10-03 12:46  robert

	* Added osgDB to dependency of osgGA

2006-10-03 11:14  robert

	* Fixed bug related to clean up of text fonts.

2006-10-03 09:55  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "This submission adds multitexture support
	  for detecting translucent
	  images used to enable alpha blending.
	  
	  Mesh was syncronized with featureset from Face record."

2006-10-03 09:39  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "I think some nitpicking is required. The
	  loop duration was added in
	  OpenFlight version 15.8. With the attached changes the flasher
	  unit
	  on the spinnercar and the character_anim model from the Creator
	  gallery behaves."

2006-10-02 15:59  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "I've included render bin checks in the
	  StateSet::compare function, because
	  without them the Optimizer can incorrectly eliminate (otherwise
	  identical)
	  StateSets from different render bins."

2006-10-02 15:38  robert

	* Added releaseGLObjects to NodeCallbacks, Drawable::DrawCallbacks
	  and wired up
	  osgProducer to use it when doing cleanup_frame.

2006-10-02 15:09  robert

	* From Paul Martz, Bug fix for sequence node direction, It examines
	  the number of children in the Group record destructor, so that
	  the total duration of the sequence matches the specified
	  loopDuration field.

2006-10-02 14:11  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "Here is the patch we discussed previously
	  about adding a flag to
	  CullSettings which allows CameraNode to inherit the clear color."

2006-10-02 13:40  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The ColorControl of osg::LightModel is
	  never applied because it
	  incorrectly checks for a valid OpenGL version. Instead of
	  checking if
	  the current version is exactly 1.2, it will check if the version
	  is
	  greater than 1.2."

2006-10-02 13:24  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is a fix for loading the same file
	  multiple times with the
	  COLLADA plugin. dae->load will not return DAE_OK the second time
	  a model is loaded, so a
	  second check for DAE_ERR_COLLECTION_ALREADY_EXISTS has been
	  added."

2006-10-02 13:11  robert

	* From Edgar Ellis, "Changed return type of osg::equivalent methods
	  from float/double to bool.
	  "

2006-10-02 13:07  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "Attached is a small bug fix in the DW
	  plugin. The texture application
	  matrix is read into a double matrix called mx, it was declared as
	  3x2,
	  it's now fixed to 3x3."

2006-10-02 11:47  robert

	* Added SERIALIZER to ReaderWriterDAE to make sure initialization
	  is thread safe.

2006-10-02 11:38  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "Attached is a modified
	  ReaderWriterDAE.cpp which creates the one and
	  only DAE instance when it's first needed instead of in the
	  constructor.
	  This fixes the problem with osgdb_dae.dll not being loaded due to
	  unwanted ordering of global initialization.
	  
	  This fix and the previous fix of the COLLADA plugin might be
	  unnecessary
	  with the latest COLLADA DOM, but since many of us will probably
	  still
	  use the older version of the DOM, I guess it's better this way.
	  "

2006-10-02 11:34  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "It seems my changes to ESRIShape.dsp (to
	  create an osgdb_shp.dll rather
	  than an osgdb_ESRI.dll) were overwritten by later commits to this
	  file.
	  Here are the changes again, made from the latest version of
	  ESRIShape.dsp."

2006-10-02 11:26  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "There was a bug in ParticleSystem where
	  the bounds is not properly
	  flagged as computed when there is only 1 particle. Attached is
	  the
	  fix."

2006-10-01 19:19  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, "These changes break out the implementation of
	  the fill/wireframe/point, texture,
	  lighting and backface culling settings from the event handling
	  code in StatesetManipulator
	  into public methods. The event handler now calls the public
	  methods. This allows user code
	  to invoke this same functionality from non-keyboard event inputs
	  without clashing with the
	  keyboard-invoked functionality."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, tweaks to the above to kepp the coding style
	  the same as the rest of the OSG, also
	  made getPolygonMode() const, and updated the wrappers.

2006-10-01 19:09  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "I have added "billboardCenter" as a reader
	  option to use the center of
	  a billboard as the pivot point."

2006-10-01 19:00  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "I have corrected a byte swapping problem in
	  the new OpenFlight
	  plugin. It was only reading floats & doubles correctly on little
	  endian systems, which require byte swapping, and not on big
	  endian systems which don't require any swapping."

2006-10-01 16:14  robert

	* Added GLUT based osgsimpleviewerGLUT example

2006-10-01 16:12  robert

2006-09-30 14:10  robert

	* Added subclassing from osg::Referenced to allow the SimpleViewer
	  to be safely managed on the heap.

2006-09-30 13:41  robert

	* Added check to init to prevent crash when no camera manipulator
	  is supplied.

2006-09-29 21:44  robert

	* Added false to setWindowRectangle() call as the InputRange is
	  already set correctly.

2006-09-29 18:47  robert

	* Added preliminary DatabasePager support.

2006-09-25 16:25  robert

	* Added bare bones osgGA::SimpleViewer class to help simplify OSG
	  setup when embedding the OSG
	  into existing GUI applications, and for one one a single camera,
	  single window is required.

2006-09-21 15:09  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-09-21 11:26  robert

	* From Eric Wing, updated to Xcode projects

2006-09-21 10:38  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I made a small modification to the
	  CullVisitor class so that it uses
	  the inheritance mask of CameraNodes with respect to the compute
	  near/far mode."

2006-09-21 10:01  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, added function for querring whether a mode
	  is a texture related mode or not.

2006-09-21 09:50  robert

	* From Loic Dachary, renamed _mips to of_mips to prevent compile
	  problem under MIIPS

2006-09-21 09:24  robert

	* Rationalized on the number of libs required.

2006-09-21 08:56  robert

	* Removed use osg OSG_LIBS, changing to just -losg and -losgDB.

2006-09-20 15:48  robert

	* Updated positions of the text labels to make them move obvious on
	  start up

	* Created stress test of fade text labelling

2006-09-20 10:36  robert

	* Updates for fade text to work properly, but only in perspetive
	  views at present.

2006-09-19 22:57  robert

	* Further work on fade text.

2006-09-19 20:19  robert

	* Further work on osgText::FadeText implementation.

2006-09-19 13:54  robert

	* Added osgfadetext example to VS projects

2006-09-18 20:54  robert

	* Introduced new osg::View, and osg::RenderInfo classes into the
	  core OSG to help
	  handle scenes with multiple views with elements that need
	  coordinating on a per view basis.
	  
	  Added beginings of new osgText::FadeText class (not functionality
	  yet).

2006-09-15 13:11  robert

	* From Per Fahlberg, "I've fixed the dae plugin so it is only using
	  one instance of the DAE.
	  The crashes seen earlier are gone, it is now possible to read
	  multiple
	  .dae files and converting both to and from .dae files."

2006-09-15 10:21  robert

	* Added a _threadHoldingMutex = 0; to ReentrantMutex::unlock() to

	* Fixed the drawArrays() method checking of _drawArrayPtr

2006-09-12 12:35  robert

	* Added a check for zero length line segment in bool
	  LineSegment::intersect(const BoundingSphere& bs,float& r1,float&
	  r2) const.

	* Added link to website for build docs.

2006-09-08 10:07  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, perl script to help remain project files for
	  dumb VisualStudio 6.0 limitations.

2006-09-07 10:41  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, added missing export to fix osgTerrain wrapper
	  linking under VS

2006-09-06 20:11  robert

2006-09-06 14:10  robert

	* Tweak to NEWS

2006-09-06 13:53  robert

	* Made get methods const

2006-09-06 09:46  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "The previous submission didn't handle
	  Objects with transforms. The
	  attached file corrects this.
	  
	  I also removed the multitexture macro for the Object record. Only
	  Face and Mesh records are valid targets."

2006-09-05 20:18  robert

	* From Eric Wing, updates to Xcode projects

2006-09-05 17:15  robert

	* Removed reference to Sony in COLLADA news entry.

2006-09-05 15:22  robert

	* Updated NEWS, AUTHORS file and osgversion for the 1.2-rc1

2006-09-05 15:09  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2006-09-05 09:51  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, build fixes for Windows.

2006-09-05 09:13  robert

	* Updated to compile against changes to osgTerrain

2006-09-05 08:56  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-09-05 08:46  robert

	* From Paul Martz, warning fixes for Cygwin.

2006-09-05 08:44  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "I have added an optimization to the
	  OpenFlight plugin. By default it
	  ignores the Object records if it's safe to do so. The reader
	  option
	  preserveObject prevents this optimization.
	  
	  I have also removed the flat shading attribute set by the Object
	  record. This flag is only intended for the "Calculate Shading"
	  operation in Creator."

2006-09-04 20:43  robert

	* Added support for imagery and DEM's that wrap around the
	  dateline, this required
	  two passes over the copying of imagery and DEM's to the
	  destination graphs, once for
	  the original position, and once for the wrap around 360 degrees
	  on or before.
	  
	  Also fixed the GeospationExtents constructor that was setting the
	  _max to DBL_MIN rather
	  than -DBL_MAX. This bug causesd the y axis to be computed
	  incorrectly.

2006-09-04 13:35  robert

	* Missing part of Farshid Laskari's submission relating to
	  CameraNode RenderOrder.

2006-09-04 13:22  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-09-04 13:15  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari,
	  
	  "I've made some changes to osg which I think make it easier to
	  control
	  the render order of CameraNode's. Instead of using the built-in
	  orders
	  (PRE_RENDER, POST_RENDER, NESTED_RENDER), you can specify an
	  integer
	  order. Values less than zero are pre rendered in order. Values
	  greater
	  than zero are post rendered in order. And a value of 0 is
	  equivalent
	  to NESTED_RENDER.
	  
	  The changes should be fully backward compatible. Also, I changed
	  the
	  RenderStageList type from a vector to a list because I needed to
	  be
	  able to insert values anywhere in the list.
	  
	  The reason I made these changes was because I wanted to be able
	  to set
	  the render order of a CameraNode at runtime without having to
	  reorder
	  it in the scenegraph."
	  
	  and later in the final submission message (relating to what has
	  been finally been merged) :
	  
	  "I've rethought my implementation and came up with something a
	  little
	  better. The setRenderOrder will continue to take an enum, but
	  will
	  have an optional orderNum parameter which can be both positive
	  and
	  negative. I think this method is more intuitive and flexible."

2006-09-04 12:52  robert

	* Cleaned up the texture setup code.

2006-09-04 12:46  robert

	* Added osg::TexMat::s/getScaleByTextureRectangleSize feature that
	  allows
	  one to use the osg::TexMat to automatically scale non dimensional
	  tex coordinats to
	  the size of the last texture rectangle applied.

2006-09-04 06:51  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, removed debug message being written to the
	  console.

	  toWString() function.
	  in Type and Type.cpp I just add two function to get a map of
	  propertyList and a map of methodList
	  i need this map in my editor a i think it's could be util to put
	  this functionnality in osgIntrospection,

	* Updated version numbers of the up comming 1.2 release

2006-08-31 20:48  robert

	* From Eric Wing, "Attached is a change for GLExtensions.cpp that
	  allows OS X to use
	  dlopen/dlsym instead of NS*Symbol* functions for 10.3 or later.
	  The
	  latter is now deprecated.
	  
	  I'm not completely sure how to test the changes. But I compiled
	  these
	  new changes in and ran the osgvertexprogram and osgshaders
	  examples
	  and they seemed to display the same results as before.
	  
	  With respect to the use of dlopen and dlsym, I was uncertain if
	  the
	  usage should look like Sun or FreeBSD (or something else).
	  Apple's man
	  pages discourage the use of RTLD_DEFAULT so I avoided the FreeBSD
	  implementation and copied the Sun implementation. I'm not sure if
	  this
	  is correct/ideal or not."

2006-08-31 20:26  robert

	* From Mike Wittman, changed release build options to reduce binary
	  bloat.

2006-08-30 09:32  robert

	* In TextureAtlasVisitor code added catch for textures that have
	  some geometry with texcoords within 0 to 1.0, but
	  others others out of the 0 to 1 range, these textures are
	  automatically rejected from consideration for adding to a texture
	  atlas.

2006-08-29 15:05  robert

	* To the TextureAtlasBuilder added detection of instance where a
	  single drawable

	  files and came across this fix to the Tesselator. From memory it
	  handles a problem with per primitive normal binding. I must have
	  forgotten to submit it."

2006-08-28 15:46  robert

	* Futher work on TextureAtlasBuilder/Visitor, now functioning
	  enough to deploy on real models.

2006-08-28 10:49  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-08-28 10:46  robert

2006-08-25 08:48  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari,
	  "I was experiencing hard crashes of my application when using
	  PBO's on
	  machines that don't support PBO's. I think osg incorrectly checks
	  if
	  PBO's are supported.
	  
	  I added a new method to the BufferObject::Extensions class which
	  returns if the "GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object" string is supported.
	  This
	  fixes the problem on my end. Machines without PBO support will
	  continue to work and machines with PBO support will still be able
	  to
	  use it."

2006-08-25 08:42  robert

	* From Eric Wing, updates to Xcode project

2006-08-24 20:16  robert

	* From David Guthrie, "I know there are 50,000 changes to osg/Math
	  for OSX a day, but I
	  think it can be simplified quite a bit. The old code includes
	  <cmath> for pre-10.2 and anything using something other than g++
	  4
	  and then uses std::isnan. For the most current version, it leaves
	  out cmath and uses isnan(). std::isnan and cmath work for the
	  current version, so I just made it include cmath if __APPLE__ is
	  defined and removed the ifdef between versions of OS X for isnan
	  related things.
	  
	  This way the code is all the same, and it's not fragile to
	  someone
	  including <cmath> prior to including osg/Math."

2006-08-24 20:15  robert

	* Simplified swap bytes code to make it more efficient.

	  source data
	  directly rather using a series of memcpy.

2006-08-23 15:11  robert

	* From Jeremy Moles, fixed typos

2006-08-23 14:17  robert

	  polygons.

2006-08-22 13:07  robert

	* From Vaclav Bilek, "The purpose of this change is to suppress
	  "re-reading" of osg::ProxyNodes
	  ( in OF external references) after the OF file is loaded. The
	  change do
	  conditional
	  execution of already existing code.
	  
	  I use this for optimized preprocessing of large databases what
	  can not
	  be loaded
	  in one pass because of memory limits."

2006-08-22 12:49  robert

	* From Gary Quinn, updated to take account of new bin directory
	  structure.

2006-08-22 12:46  robert

	* From Joran Jessurun, updated to look for lib/win32.

2006-08-22 12:33  robert

	* Fixed texture optimization problem associated with mixing already
	  compiled scene graphs - resulting
	  in incorrect texture assignment. Solution was to a
	  compareTextureObjects() test to the Texture*::compare(..) method
	  that
	  the osgUtil::Optimizer::StateSetVisitor uses to determine
	  uniqueness.

2006-08-14 11:03  robert

	* Ran dos2unix to fix inconsistent line endings

2006-08-14 07:59  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The gist of this change is, if the OpenFlight
	  version of the
	  parent file is so old that it doesn't support Light Point
	  palettes or Shader
	  palettes, then the parent file is not allowed to override those
	  palettes in
	  the child."

2006-08-10 08:45  robert

	* From Daniel Larimer, "Apple updated their developer tools again
	  and broke the __isnanf and
	  __isnand methods... replacing them with a call to isnan(v) seems

	  work on both Xcode 2.3 and 2.4"

2006-08-10 06:43  robert

	* Addd a setNodeMaskOverride(0xffffffff) to cope with models that

2006-07-31 20:56  robert

	* From Jason Beverage,
	  "I've attached fixes to DataSet that should fix the problems that
	  Maya was seeing yesterday. The issue was that the new
	  interpolation code I submitted didn't use the SourceData's
	  georef, it was assuming that the GDALDataSet had a proper
	  geo-ref. I've made the getInterpolatedValue method a member of
	  SourceData and now it uses the georef the SourceData's georef.
	  
	  I also forward declared the GDALRasterBand class in the DataSet
	  header."

2006-07-31 17:31  robert

	* Added Matrix*::getRotate()/setRotate(Quat), deprecating

2006-07-29 16:47  robert

	* Fixed multi-threaded/multi-pipe crash when primitive stats where
	  output in osgProducer::Viewer's stats.

2006-07-28 13:48  robert

	* Updated osgunittests with a matrix invert unit test, and added a
	  conditional
	  calling of invert_4x4 or invert_4x3 depending on the the right
	  hand column of the matrix.
	  
	  Updated wrappers

2006-07-27 16:41  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "This patch should fix Gert's problem that
	  he posted on osg-users. I downloaded the sample he posted,
	  reproduced the error, and added an additional check to make sure
	  the GDAL window size was valid. Now his example works fine.
	  Changes made against current CVS.
	  "

2006-07-27 15:23  robert

	* From David Spilling, "Matrix_implementation.cpp modified as
	  requested. I ran a version of it through a local version of
	  osgunittests.cpp and it passes.
	  
	  Note that firstly it always returns the positive real quaternion
	  (positive w)
	  
	  Note also that it will sometimes slightly differ from the results
	  of the other methods because it assumes that the input matrix
	  really is a rotation matrix - if it isn't, e.g. because of
	  rounding error, then the output quaternion will be very slightly
	  different. For example, the test matrix
	  
	  0 1 0 0
	  1 0 0 0
	  0 0 0.999999 0
	  0 0 0 1
	  
	  will return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0005033 0.0005033
	  
	  whereas the previous methods return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0 0.0
	  
	  However, since quaternions are rotations, the meaning of how to
	  convert a matrix that isn't a rotation is a little unclear..."

2006-07-27 11:22  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, "The ESRIShape plugin needs to produce a
	  osgdb_shp.dll rather than a
	  osgdb_ESRI.dll in Windows in order to find the correct library
	  when
	  loading shp files. A new dsp file is attached to this mail. Also,
	  the
	  ERSIShape folder should be deleted."

2006-07-12 09:50  robert

	* From Vincent Vivanloc, Removed commas from end of enum lists, and
	  removed semi-colon

2006-07-12 09:40  robert

	* From Brede Johansen,
	  
	  "I found some artifacts on some models and traced it back to the
	  external palette override feature. There are some changes in the
	  layout of the external record the loader have to take into
	  consideration.
	  
	  The other fix is to remove the OF pools from the user data of the
	  external ProxyNode when it is no longer needed."

2006-07-11 21:53  robert

	* Removed StateSet::ENCLOSE_RENDERBIN_DETAILS since it is
	  rendendent, and
	  implemented the OVERRIDE_RENDERBIN_DETAILS.

2006-07-11 14:24  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "Here's a small patch to
	  BlendFunc::setFunction(source,destination) to
	  make it consistent with the constructor and prevent the
	  BlendFuncSeparate path being called. This patch fixed the
	  artifact
	  with the osgpointsprite demo on ATI cards reported by Mike
	  Weiblen."

2006-07-11 10:34  robert

	* From Antoine Hue,
	  
	  "There was a typo in "int setNotifyOffset()", appear to be a
	  getter =>
	  "int getNotifyOffset()".
	  
	  Then I have added a switch to create GDALTermProgress only when
	  the
	  current notify level + local offset permit message display. In
	  fact, if
	  the offset is set to 0 and the notify level is at the default,
	  DataSet
	  is quiet but for the GDALTermProgress. That is quite disturbing
	  since
	  you think the progress is related to the complete processing but
	  it is
	  actually only related to the GDAL Warp."

2006-07-11 10:33  robert

2006-07-06 14:14  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky,
	  "If a texture is used that is not a multiple of four, and
	  compression
	  was requested through the texture's internal format, the
	  texture's
	  internal format reverts to a non-compressed type and a NOTICE is
	  given.
	  At present, compressed textures must have a multiple of four in
	  each

2006-07-06 14:10  robert

2006-07-06 14:02  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky,
	  
	  "Attached is some fixes for Image::readImageFromCurrentTexture.
	  It was
	  failing when used with a new Image object (some of the fields
	  were
	  not set before they were used, and some were set to the wrong
	  values).
	  A new optional parameter was added to give the desired data type,
	  which
	  defaults to GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, so programs should only need a
	  recompile
	  to work properly."

2006-07-06 09:11  robert

	* From Eric Wing, updaetes to Xcode projects

2006-07-06 08:36  robert

	* From Vivek Rajan, "Rotated text in SCREEN_COORDS was looking a
	  little squished especially
	  in orthographic projection. Performing the rotation before the
	  scaling
	  fixed the problem. I've attached Text.cpp with the fix."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, in keeping with Vivek's change moved the
	  auto rotate to screen befor the scale as well.

2006-07-05 21:52  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "The attached Texture.cpp fixes a problem
	  when subloading compressed
	  textures. Near the top of the function that implements texture
	  subloading, osg::Texture::applyTexImage2D_subload(), the local
	  variable
	  compressed_image examines the _image's_ pixel format to see if it
	  is
	  compressed. However, further on, in calls to getCompressedSize()
	  the
	  _texture's_ pixel format is used. In my application's Texture2D
	  class,
	  I use osg::Texture::USE_ARB_COMPRESSION to
	  osg::Texture2D::setInternalFormatMode(), which causes the
	  internal format
	  to become one of the generic ARB_COMPRESSED types, which do not
	  have a
	  specific size. Thus the recent warning message added to
	  osg::Texture::getCompressedSize() is triggered. The correct
	  behavior is
	  to use the format mode from the Image class instead of the
	  Texture class
	  within the subload implementation, and then the size is
	  calculated
	  correctly."

2006-07-05 21:12  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS file

2006-07-05 21:12  robert

2006-07-05 20:56  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "Changed ">" to ">=" when testing for
	  version 16.1 or later."

2006-07-05 13:44  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "There is code in Image.cpp that calculates
	  the size of a compressed image
	  based on the internal format. There is similar code in the
	  Texture class
	  but it does not account for the ARB types. I modified the Texture
	  class
	  implementation to show a warning when an incomplete internal
	  format is
	  used to calculate the image size."

2006-07-05 13:31  robert

	* Added mutex to the test context.

2006-07-05 13:18  robert

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, "Mingws gcc includes a file called
	  types.h which in turn defines
	  _TYPES_H_. types.h in the directx plugin defines the same include
	  guard. I've renamed the guard name in this file to _DX_TYPES_H_.
	  Now
	  the plugin compile in mingw too."

2006-07-05 08:55  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, renaned FLT_preserveFace to preserveFace

2006-07-04 19:58  robert

	* Changed parameter name from osberver_ptr to observer.

2006-07-04 19:54  robert

	* From Paul Martz,
	  
	  "Previously, the new OpenFlight plugin only allowed ext ref
	  models to use
	  their own palettes. With this change, parent models can override
	  child model
	  palettes with the parent palettes.
	  
	  These changes are made against very current CVS (just updated
	  about 1/2 hour
	  ago, eliminated conflicts, and retested before this posting).
	  
	  To regurgitate what I did:
	  
	  A new class, ParentPools (public osg::Referenced), is created
	  when an ext
	  ref record is parsed, and it is populated with any parent model
	  pools that
	  should override the child model pools (according to bits in the
	  ext ref
	  record). The ParentPools object is then set as UserData on the
	  ProxyNode
	  corresponding to the ext ref.
	  
	  When the ReadExternalsVisitor hits the ProxyNode, it takes its
	  UserData and
	  sets it as UserData in the Options parameter to the
	  osgDB::ReadNode call,
	  which then read the ext ref model. In the course of parsing the
	  Options
	  string, ReaderWriterFLT also looks at the Options UserData and
	  sets the
	  parent pools in the Document class accordingly.
	  
	  When palette records are encountered while loading a file, they
	  are ignored
	  if the corresponding pool was set by the parent.
	  
	  Thanks to Brede for consulting with me on the implementation.

2006-07-04 14:18  robert

	* From Stephan Huber,
	  
	  "attached you'll find some modifications to Producer, osgGA and
	  osgProducer to enable Mac OS X support for
	  
	  + scrollwheels,
	  + mightymouse-srollballs
	  + new tracking-pads with scroll feature
	  + tablet-support (pressure, proximity and pointertype) (Wacom
	  only tested)
	  
	  I think there was a bug in the windows-implementation of
	  scroll-wheel
	  support (wrong order of ScrollingMotion-enum, casting problem)
	  which is
	  fixed now.
	  
	  The scrollwheel-code is a bit klunky across platforms, some
	  devices on
	  OS X can report an absolute delta in pixel-coordinates not only
	  the
	  direction, so for now there is scrollingMotion (which describes
	  the
	  direction) and scrolldeltax and scrolldeltay. I decided to leave
	  the
	  scrollingmotion-stuff to not break old code relying on this."

2006-07-04 13:56  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-07-04 13:56  robert

	* Change osgText so that the Text drawable now can have its own
	  StateSet
	  that users can assign to it without it being overriden. If none
	  is
	  assigned externally it now uses a StateSet associated wit the
	  Font assigned
	  to the Text.

2006-07-04 13:33  robert

	* From Brede Johansen,
	  
	  "The attached file corrects two small typos in MultiSwitch.cpp.
	  The
	  local "values" reference and the "_values" member attribute are
	  of
	  different types but both are vectors so the size() operator
	  happily
	  compiles. A renaming of _values to _masks or similar may be a
	  more
	  future proof solution but the submission only removes the
	  underscore
	  in two places.
	  
	  The switch_1701.flt model part of the Creator gallery revealed
	  this bug."

2006-07-04 12:57  robert

2006-07-03 09:26  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowski, "Added the ability to read and write images
	  directly in the ive plugin,
	  through the osgDB::readImageFile and osgDB::writeImageFile
	  functions.
	  This is useful for storing compressed textures on disk for rapid
	  playback
	  for animations."

2006-07-03 09:22  robert

	* From Michael Platings, added support for blend seperates to .ive

	* From Eric Wing, added support for outline/shadow and colour
	  gradient effects.

2006-06-27 10:07  robert

	* From Terrex and Andrew Sampsom and Don Tidrow and Robert Osfield,
	  
	  email comments from Andew Sampson,
	  
	  "I've contacted Terrex, and obtained the 2.2 version
	  of their trpage library. The library included a
	  fork of OSG 0.9.8's txp plugin, modified to load 2.1+
	  txp DBs.
	  
	  I've done the work of incorporating the changes made
	  to OSG's txp plugin since 0.9.8 into Terrex's fork.
	  The forked version is now up-to-date with the changes
	  made to OSG 0.9.9 and 1.0.
	  
	  Terrex made a lot of changes (especially differences
	  in whitespace), so the diff between the forked version
	  
	  and OSG 1.0's txp plugin is yucky. I did my best, but
	  
	  keep in mind that this is the result of a 4-way merge
	  (kinda... terrex-0.9.8, stock-0.9.8, stock-0.9.9,
	  stock-1.0).
	  
	  I really want to see this forked version merged back
	  into the main OSG branch. The new features offered by
	  
	  this version of the plugin (2.1+ support, variable
	  LOD support, bug fixes) are worth the trouble."
	  
	  --
	  
	  Don Tidrow then took this code and added his work.
	  
	  --
	  
	  Robert Osfield then fixed all the warnings that abound in the
	  trpage code base.

2006-06-26 20:45  robert

	* Replaced ref_ptr<>:take with ref_ptr<>:release, and added
	  handling of removeal
	  of ref_ptr<> operator >.

2006-06-26 20:43  robert

	* Added DeleteHandler flush call.

2006-06-26 20:41  robert

	* From Tyge Løvset, ref_ptr<> template constructor, operators and
	  associated functions.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, tweaks and fixes to the above, also removed
	  the deprecated take() method.

2006-06-26 20:35  robert

	* Added a functional DeleteHandler.

2006-06-26 15:18  robert

	* From Andreas Ekstrand, fix for Windows

2006-06-26 09:56  robert

	* From Leandro Motta Barros, documentation additions to
	  PrimitiveSet & TriangleFunctor.

2006-06-26 09:30  robert

	* From Philipp Siemoleit,
	  
	  There are some group codes (i.e. "62") which are interpreted as
	  dxfDataType::SHORT. That's right because the dxf-specification
	  defines
	  "16 bit integer" as the type for the corresponding value.
	  But readerBase::readGroup() calls readValue(std::ifstream&,
	  unsigned
	  short). I changed readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) to
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, short). I found no group code at the
	  dxf-specs
	  which needs a "16 bit unsigned integer" value. So the
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) function is obsolete -
	  right?

2006-06-26 09:18  robert

	* From David Fries, Reset only the RenderLeaf objects used in the
	  last
	  frame as given by the _currentReuseRenderLeafIndex instead of
	  resetting all leaves which can be very time consuming.

2006-06-26 09:09  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, added osgGA dependency to osgkeyboardmouse

	* From Paul Martz, clean up of comments.

2006-06-08 12:07  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, reverted shaders changes due to lack of
	  hardware/driver support

2006-06-08 11:58  robert

	* From Gustavo Wagner, addition of trim method to TemplateArray
	  class.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, made trim method a virtual method of the
	  base Array class
	  and added a trim implementation to TemplateIndexArray.

2006-06-08 11:56  robert

	* From Paul Martz, fixed incorrect filename in project file

2006-06-08 11:39  robert

	* With direction from Paul Melis, fixed bug in
	  CopySharedSubgraphsVisitor which prevented
	  it being applied. Also fix inappropriate comment.

2006-06-08 11:22  robert

	* From Joan Abadie: patch fixes : "osgDB::makeDirectory doesn't
	  work on win32 when using full path name like : "d:/demo"
	  it tryes a mkdir("d:")."

2006-06-08 11:19  robert

	* Improved stats sizing in presense of wide screens.

2006-05-29 09:08  robert

	* Reverted changes from revision 1.4, as they look like a temporary
	  hack not intended
	  to be merged.

2006-05-26 15:19  robert

	* From Jason Baverage, support for interpolating DEM data from GDAL
	  to the positions

	  Brede and I have submitted
	  changes to this plugin that aren't in current CVS yet -- this
	  change is
	  based on current CVS, not our changed files.)
	  
	  This changes how shader palette records are parsed to support
	  GLSL per the
	  OpenFlight 16.1 spec. Existing functionality for 16.0 files is
	  preserved.
	  
	  The change to Document.h simply adds an enum for VERSION_16_1."

2006-05-15 13:13  robert

	* Replaced BoundingBox with GeospatialExtents.

2006-05-15 13:12  robert

2006-05-15 11:48  robert

	* From Daniel Trastenjak, added checking of binding modes to ensure
	  that changes are only applied
	  when the binding mode changes, thereby avoiding uncessary calls
	  to dirtyDisplayList.
	  
	  Note, from Robert Osfield, moved bodies of set*Binding() into
	  Geometry.cpp to avoid
	  clutter in the header.

2006-05-15 11:38  robert

	* From Adrian Egli, added std::ifstream::binary qualifier to

	* From Brede Johansen,
	  "- Replaced some member attributes with local variables in Face

	  Vertex array)
	  - new Mesh (with reserved field at offset 12, thanks to Paul
	  Martz)
	  - new LocalVertexPool
	  - new MeshPrimitive
	  - Use ProxyNode for externals.
	  - Local cache for externals"

	  Added Quake3 BSP plugin.

2006-05-09 09:47  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The drawInner() method of
	  osgUtil::RenderStage ignores the
	  checkForGLErrors flag of the osg::State object. The attatched
	  file
	  fixes this."

2006-05-09 09:42  robert

	* From Tree, build fixes for JavaOSG build.

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The setScale(Vec3) method of
	  osg::AutoTransform does not dirty the
	  matrix. The fix is attached."

2006-05-04 19:39  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2006-05-04 19:36  robert

	* Added removeChild(unsigned int, unsigned int) back in for
	  backward compatibility.

2006-05-04 19:15  robert

	* Fixed expire of children to work with the new
	  Group::removeChildren method.

2006-05-02 15:52  robert

	* Added selective support for thread safe ref/unref such that the
	  rendering
	  backend now doesn't use thread safe ref counting where
	  multi-buffering exists.
	  This reduces the overhead of multi-threading.

2006-05-02 09:50  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-05-02 09:49  robert

	* Fixed docs on GL_SCALE_NORMAL

2006-05-02 09:45  robert

	* Reorganised the Group::removeChild and Geode::removeDrawable
	  methods so
	  that removeChild(Node*), removeChild(uint) and equivilant Geode
	  methods are
	  now inline methods, not designed to be overriden, and seperated
	  out the
	  multiple remove method to be called removeChildren(uint, uint)
	  which is
	  now the only virtual method. There removeChildren is now the
	  method to
	  override in subclasses.
	  
	  This reorganisation requires some call code to be rename
	  removeChild usage
	  to removeChildren.

	  GraphicsContext to
	  keep it in sync with the calling graphics context.

2006-04-14 16:44  robert

	* Added inline shaders so that the tha example can be run from any
	  directory.

	* Added fog parameters settings.

2006-04-14 08:28  robert

	* From Ben Discoe, added missing drawable->dirtyDisplayList().

2006-04-13 20:21  robert

	* Added --numberOfParticles, --numberOfCellsX, --numberOfCellsY,

	* Implement positioning of cells via vertex attribute.

2006-04-12 09:42  robert

	* Moved common uniforms to top of precipitation subgraph.
	  
	  Added a run of the SpatializeGroupVisitor to create a balanced
	  subgraph.
	  
	  Changed the quad to particle transistion distance from 100 to
	  50m.

2006-04-11 19:56  robert

	* Added support for LOD's with transistion between quads and point
	  rendering.

2006-04-11 13:22  robert

	* Added support for point sprite particle effects.

2006-04-11 10:53  robert

	* Added point and line paths.

2006-04-11 08:44  robert

	* Added setting of the
	  DisplaySettings::setMaxNumberOfGraphicsContext() to the
	  number of contexts required by Producer.

2006-04-10 15:45  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, osgprecipitation project file.

2006-04-07 19:54  robert

	* Added mipmap generation.

2006-04-07 18:24  robert

	* Added quad based rain effect

2006-04-06 14:06  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, added MergeGeode visitor to
	  osgUtil::Optimizer.

2006-04-05 15:13  robert

	* Added beginings osgprecipitation example.

2006-04-04 23:22  don

	* Fixed a bug in the DelaunayTriangulator uniquify points method.
	  Was always
	  skipping the first point.

2006-04-04 14:10  robert

	* Added missing .js file.

2006-04-04 13:47  robert

	* From Joran Jessurun and Chris Hanson, Visual Studio Static build
	  support.

2006-04-04 13:20  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-04-04 12:58  robert

	* Converted SceneHandlerList to use Producer::ref_ptr<>

2006-04-04 12:53  robert

	* From Eric Wing, XCode project files.

2006-04-03 19:14  robert

	* #if'd out use of barrier for stats collection.

2006-04-03 18:25  robert

	* Updates to osgProducer to bring it up to speed with changes in
	  Producer

2006-03-28 16:08  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, changes to internal help class in prep for
	  array uniform support.
	  Small tweaks for build under Linux from Robert Osfield.

2006-03-28 14:45  robert

	* From Glenn Waldrom, addition of .ive support for PriorityOffset
	  and PriorityScale.

2006-03-28 10:45  robert

	* From Eric Sokolosky, added help for
	  PRODUCER_CAMERA_BLOCK_ON_VSYNC

2006-03-28 10:28  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, added support for new OSG_IMAGE_FILE_NAME env
	  var for
	  setting the default name to use when writing out captured images
	  from the
	  viewer.

2006-03-27 20:30  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog.

2006-03-18 07:07  robert

	* From Farshid Lasharki, added IO suppoty fo
	  osgParticle::ConstantRateContour

2006-03-17 22:25  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-03-17 22:23  robert

	* Added exports.

2006-03-17 22:22  robert

	* From Keith Steffen, changed instance of sun to sun_geode to avoid
	  Solaris10 build issue with it defining "sun"?#!

2006-03-17 14:05  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, Added ability to read/write the texture
	  tile
	  settings of osgParticle::Particle to .osg files.

2006-03-17 11:28  robert

	* From Sohey Yamamoto, fixed eroneous CHECK_BLACK_LISTED_MODES enum
	  value, changing 0xA0 to 0x100

2006-03-15 15:49  robert

	* Added createEvent() convinience method.

2006-03-15 12:26  robert

	* Added comment on the meaning of the matrix paramter in the
	  computeIntersections methods.

2006-03-15 12:26  robert

	* Added moving sphere segment intersections.

2006-03-15 11:21  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, build fix for Win32.

2006-03-15 10:36  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, added ESRIShape.dsp project

2006-03-14 13:18  robert

	* Build fixes

2006-03-14 09:33  robert

	* Added 21 as the version number of xine video plugin to allow it
	  work with latest versions of xine.

2006-03-14 09:23  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, added normals VS project

2006-03-13 21:29  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "The following patch adds a multisample
	  option to the
	  osg::DisplaySettings class. OsgCameraGroup will now read the
	  setting
	  from the DisplaySettings instead of hardcoding the value. I added
	  the
	  following commandline option to be able to set the multisample
	  value:
	  
	  --samples <num>
	  
	  One thing to note, OsgCameraGroup would previously check if the
	  computer is an SGI and set multisample to 4. I retained this
	  check in
	  DisplaySettings to be backwards compatible."

2006-03-13 21:20  robert

	* From Andrew Sampson, "The terravista terrain generation tool can
	  insert references to external model files into a terrapage tile.
	  It unfortunately does not update the bounding sphere of that tile
	  to include the extents of the external model. This means that if
	  a large model (such as an airfield model) is attached to a tile,
	  the model will disappear when the tile is off-screen (outside the
	  view volume), even though the model is on-screen."

2006-03-13 13:19  robert

	* Added an EventQueue directly into osgProducer::Viewer.

2006-03-09 15:16  robert

	* Checked in the genwrapper generated Export.cpp. This does seem to
	  be an eroneously
	  built file though since Export.cpp doesn't appear in the other
	  plugins... I have checked
	  it in here to keep the builds running, there isn't actually any
	  useful body in the Export.cpp.

2006-03-09 13:02  robert

	* Ran dos2unix on new OpenFlight files.

2006-03-08 21:38  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, new OpenFlight plugin!!!!!
	  
	  By default the original flt plugin is still used, to select at
	  runtime
	  the new plugin set the env OSG_OPEN_FLIGHT_PLUGIN=new

2006-03-08 16:11  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, added osg::getGlVersion() and fixed a minor typo
	  in Texture3D.

2006-03-08 15:40  robert

	* Added EventQueue.

2006-03-08 15:30  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "A while back the behaviour of extension
	  alias' was modified so that
	  the user can override existing alias'. The change allowed for
	  circular
	  references, so the createLibraryNameForExtension would get caught
	  in
	  an endless loop. The following fix will catch circular
	  references."

2006-03-08 15:26  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed that sometimes when a particle
	  emitter is re-enabled, a few
	  particles will appear at the location it was disabled at. The
	  problem
	  is that the previous local to world matrix is not being updated
	  while
	  it is disabled. I modified the particle processor so that it will
	  set
	  the dirty flag for the previous local to world matrix when the
	  processor is skipped for a frame, since the value will no longer
	  be
	  relevant."

2006-03-08 15:16  robert

	* From Roger James, "1. Fixed a problem with the caching of
	  textures when the associated image file was not in the current
	  working directory. In this case the texture object was being
	  placed in the cache with the short filename, but was looked up
	  with the full path.
	  
	  2. Fixed a problem with the caching of textures when CACHE_IMAGES
	  was enabled. This caused a conflict is the names used to cache
	  the image and texture objects.
	  
	  3. Fixed a problem where AC3D generates surfaces with duplicate
	  vertex indices.
	  
	  4. Removed what I believe are redundant calls to the tesselator.
	  
	  5. Added a couple of asserts which should fire in debug mode if
	  my assumptions about 4. are incorrect.
	  
	  6. Removed obviously unused code. (Stuff that was commented or
	  ifdeffed out.)"
	  
	  Note, from Robert Osfield, changed the asserts to if () report
	  error using notify so we can catch errors in both optimized and
	  debug builds, but without crashing.

2006-03-08 14:09  robert

	* Converted osgGA::GUIEventAdapter into a concrete class capable of
	  respresenting
	  keyboard and mouse events.
	  
	  Added osgGA::EventQueue class to support a thread safe event
	  queue and adaption
	  of keyboard and mouse events.
	  
	  Removed osgProducer::EventAdapter as GUIEventAdapter replaces it.
	  
	  Adapted osgProducer and examples to work with the new changes to
	  osgGA.

2006-03-07 18:26  don

	* Improved the GET protocol for the http socket. By adding
	  Connection: close
	  the server sends a EOF immediately after the data, improving
	  performance
	  because readers are not left waiting for EOF.

2006-03-05 20:46  robert

	* Began work on making EventVisitor capable of adapting events
	  directly.

2006-03-02 20:39  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, support for writing to istream for the the
	  TIFF plugin and support for
	  controlling PNG compression level via the the
	  ReaderWriter::Option string "PNG_COMPRESSION <level>"

2006-03-02 20:31  robert

	* Added automatic toggling between png and jpeg when
	  compressImageData option is used. Jpeg
	  is used to compress RGB data only, the just of the formats are
	  passed on to the png plugin.

2006-03-02 15:26  robert

	* From Robert Swain, compile fix for debian unstable.

2006-03-02 14:58  robert

	* From Farshid Lashakari, support for png write.

2006-03-01 10:17  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached another modified version of
	  the IVE loader which
	  supports compressing the image data. The option to compress the
	  data
	  is "compressImageData". Currently it uses the jpeg plugin to
	  write the
	  image. Maybe we could add an option that allows the user to
	  specify
	  which image format to use. The jpeg writer supports specifying
	  the
	  quality of the jpeg, so you could use the following command line
	  to
	  convert the skydome.osg model to IVE using 50% jpeg quality:
	  
	  osgconv -O "compressImageData JPEG_QUALITY 50" skydome.osg
	  skydome.ive"

2006-02-28 21:18  robert

	* Added TextureRectangle.cpp

2006-02-28 20:10  robert

	* Compile fix.

2006-02-28 19:46  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, added missing array handling into
	  Geometry::accept(AttributeFunctor&
	  af) and Geometry::accept(ConstAttributeFunctor& af).

2006-02-28 19:36  robert

	* Further clean up of RefNodePath references.

2006-02-28 19:12  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-02-28 18:54  robert

	* Fixes to removed dependency on RefNodePath.

2006-02-27 19:51  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-02-27 19:49  robert

	* Ported NodeTrackCallback and NodeTrackManipulator across to use
	  oberserver_ptr
	  instead of RefNodePath.
	  
	  Removed now redundent RefNodePath.

2006-02-27 19:48  robert

	* Added support in osg::computeWorldToLocal and compteLocalToWorld
	  functions for automatically
	  stripping any absolute or root CameraNode's from the NodePaths.
	  
	  Added osg::Node::getWorldMatrices() convinience method.

2006-02-27 19:44  robert

	* Added new observer_ptr templated smart pointer to allow one to
	  retain pointers
	  to objects but have the pointer reset to null if that object is
	  deleted.

2006-02-26 17:45  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I've made some changes to the IVE loader
	  which will add the capability
	  of saving image files inside the IVE file. Currently, only the
	  raw
	  image data is saved into the file. If your model uses jpg images
	  as
	  textures then this will cause your file size to increase.
	  
	  I've added an option that will embed the original image file into
	  the
	  IVE file. The IVE file will then attempt to read the image from
	  memory. Since most image loaders support reading from memory,
	  this
	  shouldn't be a problem. To use this new feature the user must
	  specify
	  the option "includeImageFileInIVEFile" when converting to IVE.
	  
	  I tested this out on the "skydome.osg" model that comes with OSG.
	  Using the old method, the IVE file size would be 785 KB, with the
	  new
	  method it is only 42 KB.
	  
	  Also, I've added the support for TextureRectangle's to the IVE
	  reader/writer."

2006-02-24 13:57  robert

	* Added debugging code to help pick out instablilities in
	  osgParticle. Debugging
	  code now commented out.

2006-02-24 13:56  robert

	* Added clamping of the wind force contribution to acceletion of
	  particle so
	  that the de-acceleration never exceed the actual wind vector
	  itself.

2006-02-23 20:37  robert

	* Completed .osg support for ClusterCullingCallback.

2006-02-23 16:47  robert

	* Disabled the running of tristripping and smoothing from within
	  the Simplifier.

2006-02-23 12:41  robert

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, spelling fixes.

2006-02-23 12:39  robert

	* Fixed function name call.

2006-02-22 20:51  robert

	* Fixed getBound() comment.

2006-02-22 19:28  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2006-02-22 19:14  robert

	* Fixed typo of Validity.

2006-02-22 16:05  robert

	* From Thom Carlo, with tweak from Robert Osfield, removed the
	  setting of the outline colour
	  (the emission part of material) during setup of the Carton
	  effects for the second pass.

2006-02-22 14:35  robert

	* Fixed documentation.

2006-02-22 14:31  robert

	* Added support for OpenGL mode black listing to provide better
	  support
	  for extension checking and invalidation of OpenGL modes
	  associated with
	  extensions.

2006-02-21 21:29  robert

	* Added ClusterCullingCallback.cpp

2006-02-21 21:28  robert

	* Added initial cut of ClusterCullingCallback .osg support.

2006-02-21 14:34  robert

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, spelling fixes.

2006-02-21 13:55  robert

	* From Gordon Tomlinson, VS2005 Syntax highling regonition.

2006-02-21 13:51  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "I've attempted to make AutoTransform override
	  computeBounds() to return
	  an invalid bounding sphere if it hasn't seen a cull traversal
	  yet. It
	  depends on _firstTimeToSetEyePoint, which is initially true, then
	  false
	  after a cull. There might be a better way? If so, let me know.
	  
	  This change does resolve the issue I had encountered with auto
	  scale to
	  screen and incorrect culling."

2006-02-21 12:39  robert

	* From Trajce Nikolov, "small fix for the flt loader - the back
	  color of the bidirectional light points"

2006-02-20 21:05  robert

	* From Ulrich Hertlein, spelling corrections and a few Doxgen
	  comments.

2006-02-20 20:06  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, "There was a problem with the PNG plugin
	  when it encounters an image that is
	  less than 8 bits per pixel (this can happen with greyscale or
	  paletted images).
	  It was a pretty simple problem to fix."

2006-02-20 19:13  robert

	* From Nathan Monteleone, addition of AutoTransform support.

2006-02-20 16:50  robert

	* Moved the intialization variable reset to end of the init
	  funciton to
	  avoid multi-thread initialization from producing different
	  results.

2006-02-20 16:20  robert

	* From Ed Ralston, "According to the OSX Developer Documentation,
	  CFRelease
	  cannot be called with a NULL argument.
	  
	  This patch prevents osgDB::FileUtils from doing this."

2006-02-20 15:46  robert

	* Added missing swap byte operations to readVec*sArray() methods.

2006-02-20 15:32  robert

	* From Daniel Larimer, fixed error is swap byte code handling
	  vector<short>

2006-02-20 15:25  robert

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, "when building debug libs in mingw the
	  .dll.a files are not copied to
	  the lib/MINGW(32) folder. The makefiles in the attached zip
	  should fix this."

2006-02-09 19:31  don

	* Fixed a bug spotted in UFOManipulator where a Vec3's 4th
	  component was
	  being inspected (ip[3]).

2006-02-09 12:20  robert

	* Added BlenColour(Vec4) constructor and updated wrappers.

2006-02-08 23:41  don

	* Added a filter to the Delaunay Triangulator to insure that
	  incoming points
	  are unique in the X and Y components.

2006-02-06 20:36  robert

	* Added s/getDoTriStrip and s/getSmoothing method.

2006-02-06 19:41  don

	* Added normals and ESRIshape directories to makedirdefs

2006-02-06 19:40  don

	* Added 'normals' pseudoloader

2006-02-06 19:16  robert

	* Improved default settings, re-enambled smoothing and tri
	  stripping of sampled data.

2006-02-06 17:12  robert

	* Added support for up sampling by dividing longest edges.

2006-02-05 21:53  robert

	* From David Guthrie, OSX marco reworking to better handling
	  different OSX versions.

2006-02-04 21:25  robert

	* From Edmond Gheury, fixe and bug in the PrimitiveShapeVisitor.

2006-02-04 21:20  robert

	* From Marco Jez, " I've modified in order to make FBO mipmapping
	  work. In
	  FrameBufferObject.cpp there is also another fix: when
	  initializing a FBO
	  attachment from a CameraNode attachment, the renderbuffer's
	  format must be
	  set to the attachment's internal format, not to the image's pixel
	  format.
	  
	  Another problem is that attaching a renderbuffer to the FBO
	  through
	  CameraNode is not simple (if not impossible) if you don't intend
	  to specify
	  an Image object. Probably CameraNode could be enriched with an
	  "attach(buffer, width, height, format)" method. For example if
	  you attach a
	  color buffer as a texture whose size is different than that of
	  the
	  CameraNode's viewport you also need to attach a depth buffer of
	  the same
	  size, because the depth buffer that is automatically attached by
	  RenderStage
	  has the viewport's size. FBOs require that all attachment have
	  the same
	  dimensions, so said setup will fail if you can't specify a custom
	  depth
	  renderbuffer"

2006-02-04 21:12  robert

	* From Marco Jez:
	  
	  here is a patch that enables a new option named
	  "BIND_TEXTURE_MAP" in the LWO plugin. Its purpose is to allow
	  explicit binding between texture UV maps defined in the LWO file
	  and OpenGL texture units, overriding the default mechanism that
	  allocates texture units automatically. This is useful when you
	  have an UV map built in Lightwave (for example an atlas map) but
	  no textures actually using it, so you can keep the UV map (that
	  would be discarded otherwise) and add a texture later int your
	  program.
	  
	  Syntax is:
	  BIND_TEXTURE_MAP <map_name> <texunit>

2005-11-18 14:49  robert

	* From Toshiyuki Takeahei, addition of s/getDistance() methods

2005-11-18 14:46  robert

	* The OpenFlight plugin was crashing with pre 15.6 .flt files that
	  contained
	  light points. This was due to the mismatch is size and fiels in
	  the LightPointRecord
	  before 15.6 and after it, the OSG's flt plugin was assuming just
	  15.6 record
	  structure. As a temporary solution I have disabled the processing
	  of light point
	  records on .flt file version before 15.6, this allows these files
	  to be loaded
	  safely, but without light points.

2005-11-18 10:03  robert

	* From Andrew Reyonolds : changed the endian conversion code to
	  work on a temporary
	  rather then on a flt structure to prevent repeated conversion of
	  the same value,
	  something that led to eroneously large light point string sizes.

2005-11-18 09:52  robert

	* From Rodger James, changed the Win32 static library compilation
	  support to use

	  required.

2005-11-17 20:22  robert

2005-11-17 15:18  robert

	* From Toshiyuki Takahei, added #pragam to avoid build problem with
	  special characters.

	  to just VisualStudio,
	  and added comment explaining all the extra parsing code in
	  osgversion.

2005-11-17 15:03  robert

	  errors that slip thru the nvidia compiler.
	  gl_TexCoord[] is an array of vec4, and must be reduced to a vec2
	  for use with texture2D()"

2005-11-17 11:13  robert

	* From Eric Sokolosky, for Cygwin and Minw sections changed
	  definition of INST_SHARE
	  so that it is based on INST_LOCATION, providing the same default
	  as before but
	  also allow it to be override by env vars when required.

2005-11-17 11:09  robert

	* From Eric Sokolosky, made spacing more consistent.

	* From Toshiyuki Takehei, typo fix of getTrackerMode().

2005-11-14 11:00  robert

	* Change the KeySwitchMatrixManipulator so that it two sets of
	  getMatrixManipulator
	  methods, two that takes an index,two that takes a key value.
	  Updated the ViewEventHandler
	  so the it now uses the getMatrixManipulatorWithIndex() method to
	  avoid previous ambiguity.

2005-11-14 09:31  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari : "I reported earlier about a problem with
	  a custom emitter I was using.
	  I spent some more time debugging and it turns out there was a bug
	  in
	  the ParticleSystem::update_bounds function. When the bound is
	  being
	  reset, both the min and max are being set to the same postion
	  without
	  the radius being subtracted/added to it. When there is only one
	  particle alive in the system this causes it to be culled by small
	  feature culling. I've modifed the function so that when the bound
	  is
	  reset, the radius is subtracted/added to the position. This fixes
	  my
	  problem."

2005-11-12 21:29  robert

	  a test of osg-cvs)

2005-11-09 20:30  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2005-11-09 20:26  robert

2005-11-09 15:14  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-11-09 15:11  robert

	* Added the support in AnimationPathCallback for taking a pivot,
	  axis and rotation rate
	  paramters in its constructor to allow it to be used to create
	  rotations around a point.
	  This provides the same interface and functionality as
	  osgUtil::TransformCallback but
	  has the advantage and AnimationPathCallback is fully supported by
	  the .osg and .ive file formats.

2005-11-09 13:39  robert

	* Updated the runexamples.bat to include glsl_mandelbrot.osg and
	  glsl_julia.osg references

2005-11-09 13:39  robert

	* Reduced the size of the "oversized" cessna.osg

2005-11-09 13:26  robert

	* Added a test of isRealized to requestWrapPointer to prevent a
	  deadlock condition occur when a wap pointer is done before a
	  window is realized.

2005-11-09 13:18  robert

	* Update texture file names to reflect new files in
	  OpenSceneGraph-Data distribution.

	* Added dxf VS6.0 project

2005-11-09 10:49  robert

	* Bumped the version numbers up to 1.0 in preparation for 1.0-rc1.

2005-11-09 10:37  robert

	* Fixed compile warning.

2005-11-09 09:30  robert

	  to draw later.

2005-11-08 16:41  robert

	* Added .ive support for osg::Texture SourceFormat and SourceType

2005-11-08 16:22  robert

2005-11-08 16:02  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-11-08 15:52  robert

	* From Brad Colbert/Robert Osfield: added s/getSourceFormat and
	  s/getSourceType to osg::Texture
	  along with support for this Texture1D, 2D, 3D, TextureCubeMap and
	  TextureRectangle. The
	  new SourceFormat and SourceType parameters are only used when no
	  osg::Image is assigned to
	  an osg::Texture, and main use is for render to texture effects.
	  
	  Added support for --hdr option in osgprerender, which utilises
	  the new Texture::setSourceFormat/Type() methods.

2005-11-08 14:03  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2005-11-08 13:51  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, fixed image size calculation in
	  getTotalSizeInBytesIncludingMipmaps(),
	  added checks on success of opening files for writing in the .ive
	  plugin.

2005-11-08 11:46  robert

	* Added sorting and clearing of pre and post RenderStages stored in
	  RenderStage,
	  and added some debugging comments which are currently commented
	  out from compilation -
	  these are left in just in case future debug work requires them.

2005-11-08 09:36  robert

	* Changed the occluder traversal so that checks the children of the
	  SceneView's Cameara
	  rather than starting at the camera itself.

2005-11-07 16:52  robert

	* Renamed VisualStudio.dsw to OpenSceneGraph.dsw

2005-11-07 16:48  robert

	* Improved the handling of CameraNode and viewers with projection
	  matrices
	  contained NaN's.

2005-11-07 15:46  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, proper c++ cast instead of c-cast for
	  ApplicationUsage

2005-11-07 15:43  robert

	* From Steve Lunsford, added psuedo event dispatch to init within
	  selectCameraManipulator
	  to force the new minpulator to update correctly.

2005-11-07 14:42  robert

	* From David Spilling, added "noRotation" ReaderWriter::Option into
	  the .obj plugin
	  to enable disabling of the automatic rotation from Y up
	  coordinate frame to Z up coordinate frame.

2005-11-07 13:54  robert

	* From Marco Jez, Added an unregister of the
	  GraphicsContextImplement on unload.

2005-11-07 12:41  robert

	* From David Spilling, fix for typo of OVERRIDE.

2005-11-07 11:14  robert

	* From Gideon May, compile fixes for OSX.

2005-11-07 11:09  robert

	* From Norman Vine, "Cygwin uses unix style path separators"

2005-11-07 11:05  robert

	* From Wang Lam,"The changes allow users of OpenSceneGraph to call
	  a new function
	  readFontStream() to load fonts from a std::istream, rather than
	  from the
	  local filesystem by name. Such a call may be used, for example,
	  if the
	  user has a font fetched over a network, or a font available in
	  memory
	  without a correspondng filename.
	  
	  The changes implement the new function by following the
	  corresponding code
	  for readFontFile(). readFontStream() reads a stream into memory,
	  and
	  holds that memory for FreeType.
	  
	  As a basic test, I mangled the osgtext example to use
	  readFontStream(std::ifstream("font")) in lieu of a readFontFile
	  call, and
	  the modified example ran completely."

2005-11-07 10:29  robert

	* From Ruben (with a few addition/changes from Robert), fixed the
	  commandline of the osgsimplifier example. It now reads
	  --ratio and --max-error.
	  
	  ---------------------------------------------------

2005-11-04 19:00  robert

	* Added extra debugging checks on FBO's

2005-11-04 12:08  robert

	* Improved support for texture subload/render to texture in various
	  Texture classes
	  and RenderStage.

2005-11-03 21:35  robert

	* Improvements to CameraNode IO support, now handles render to
	  texture.

2005-11-03 19:20  robert

	* Changed the CameraNode read/write code to use Transform as its
	  parent.

2005-11-03 17:12  robert

	* Removed debugging message

2005-11-03 17:08  robert

2005-11-03 10:16  robert

	* Added initial CameraNode and CameraView stups for the .ive loader

2005-11-03 10:01  robert

	* From Eric Sokolowsky, added writeEnvironmentSettings to help
	  report what OSG
	  centric environment variables are used.

2005-11-03 09:03  robert

	* Added CameraNode.cpp and CameraView.cpp

2005-11-02 19:52  robert

	* Inital work on adding .osg support for CameraNode and CameraView.

2005-11-02 19:35  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-11-02 19:15  robert

	* Added request for accumulator buffer.

2005-11-02 19:15  robert

	* Added support in DisplaySettings and OscCameraGroup for
	  requesting accumulator buffer.

	* From Alan Ott, added support for palletted imagery.

2005-11-02 15:56  robert

	* From Brede Johnasen, changed wrap mode to CLAMP_TO_EDGE to avoid
	  edges being
	  seen when zoomed into the reflectio map.

2005-11-02 15:23  robert

	* Added handling of CameraNode into PickVisitor in
	  src/osgProducer/Viewer.cpp. This
	  is unlikely to be the final solution, but does at least fix part
	  of the problem of handling
	  picking HUD's underneath CameraNodes.

2005-11-02 14:24  robert

	* From Marco Jez, added Image/ path to image files to help find
	  them from the OpenSceneGraph-Data directory.

2005-11-02 14:22  robert

	* From Marco Jez, moved the rear view camera's viewport to the
	  bottom left of window to accomdate a greater range of display
	  sizes.
	  From Robert Osfield, made the background colour of the intersted
	  camera a scaled down verson of the main background colour to make
	  it more obvious.

2005-11-02 12:22  robert

	* Added a setSupportsDisplayList(false) to constructor to prevent
	  end users
	  enabling display lists, something that can break the osgText's
	  managment
	  of state.

2005-11-02 11:55  robert

	* Fixed setCameraRequiresSetUp so it properly uses the bool passed
	  to it.

2005-11-02 11:33  robert

	* Added doc comment and removed redundent inline keyword

2005-11-02 10:57  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, "I need the ability to check for a font
	  file without actually loading
	  the font object. I've modified font.h/cpp of osgText so that it
	  exports the findFontFile function."

2005-11-02 10:55  robert

	* From Marco Jez, commented out debuggin message.

2005-11-02 10:49  robert

	* Added static orthoNormal function to match equivilant in Matrixd

2005-11-02 10:45  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Fix for missing class name qualifier on the
	  orthoNormal function."

2005-11-02 10:29  robert

	* From Colin McDonald, "Fixes for some duplicate global symbol
	  definitions in the plugins,
	  which cause errors when creating a statically linked executable."

2005-11-02 10:29  robert

	* Fixed compile warning

2005-11-01 20:16  robert

	* Changed the error number reporting to be reported as hex.

2005-11-01 19:32  robert

	* Added an image negation callback to the render to image. Added
	  commandline docs
	  for the new --image and --texture-rectangle options.

2005-11-01 19:31  robert

	* Removed the double call to the camera post draw callback.

2005-11-01 17:07  robert

	* Added usage of image copy and modification.

2005-11-01 15:39  robert

	* Set the draw and read buffer to GL_NONE when using FBO's, thereby
	  avoid
	  invalid enumrates being generated.

2005-11-01 15:23  robert

	* Improved handling of osg::Image copying.

2005-11-01 11:18  robert

	* From Brad Colbert, Added checking for a NULL return string rom
	  gluErrorString (with slight reformating of this by Robert
	  Osfield.)

2005-11-01 11:00  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2005-11-01 10:42  robert

	* Added RenderTargetFallback option into osg::CameraNode.

2005-10-31 16:40  robert

	* From Steve Lunsford, "Attached is a copy of TXPNode.cpp with the
	  repaired computeBounds call. I
	  discovered that TXPNodes were being culled out prematurely
	  because the
	  loaded sub-tiles resulted in a computed bounds that was smaller
	  than the
	  extents indicated in the archive. I think this fix should be
	  fine. I can't
	  think of any reason why we would want to use anything other than
	  the archive
	  extents."

2005-10-31 14:48  robert

	* Added default setting of _threading_model to ThreadPerCamera when
	  multiple cameras
	  are present, and SingleThreaded when a single camera is being
	  used.

2005-10-31 11:43  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, "some tweaks to the osgSim lightpoints.
	  
	  - The first change is to start fadeing a lightpoint just before
	  the
	  maximum distance of a light is reached.
	  - The second change is to start fading a lightpoint when
	  pixelSize is
	  less than _minPixelSize instead of 1.0."

2005-10-29 11:29  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-29 10:04  robert

	* Added catch for NULL return from glGetString( GL_VERSION );

2005-10-29 09:52  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-28 18:39  robert

	* From Marco Jez, Fix for the class name lookup in
	  osgDB::Registry::writeObject(), which can silently fail when a
	  NodeKit's class (for example osgNVCg::Program) has the same name
	  as that of an OSG's class (for example osg::Program).

2005-10-28 18:37  robert

	* Fixed env var docs for sharing graphics contexts.

2005-10-28 14:02  robert

	* Added warning message for when no file is loaded.

2005-10-28 13:18  robert

	* From Ravi Mathur, "Here is an update to BlendEquation that adds
	  checking for the
	  SGIX_blend_alpha_minmax and EXT_blend_logic_op extensions. It is
	  tested with the osgblendequation example. If the extensions are
	  not
	  supported, a WARN level notification is generated."

2005-10-28 13:11  robert

	* Moved SceneView across to use an osg::CameraNode to store the
	  projection and view matrices,
	  the viewport, the clear colour and the subgraph needing rendered.
	  This is done
	  transparently so all existing functionality will behave as
	  before. What it does
	  add is the ability to set a SceneView directly by a single
	  osg::CameraNode when required.

2005-10-28 10:33  robert

	* Changed debug message from NOTICE to INFO level of notification

2005-10-28 10:11  robert

	* Added command line option --overlay to turn on the use of an
	  OverlayNode.

2005-10-28 09:20  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

	  was
	  supported in the OpenGL driver.

2005-10-27 13:53  robert

	* Added option to osgdepthpartion for loading the model specified
	  on the commandline.

2005-10-27 11:15  robert

	* Added documentation line about 32 being the maximum permitted
	  number of line segmenets

2005-10-27 11:11  robert

	* Added error message to report when too many line segments are
	  added to an IntersectVisitor.

2005-10-27 10:48  robert

	* Added support for tracking the directory of the output file
	  whilst still maintaining
	  local file references within this directory.

2005-10-27 09:38  robert

	* From Ravi Mathur, "New functionality is the ability to
	  automatically determine the
	  maximum traversal depth necessary to obtain an accurate estimate
	  of
	  the minimum number of required cameras. In addition, the user can
	  specify an absolute maximum traversal depth that will not be
	  exceeded."

2005-10-27 09:37  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, update to osgdelaunday.

2005-10-26 20:30  robert

	* From Don Tidrow, bug fix to setOutputTextureFiles(bool).

2005-10-26 20:22  robert

	* Added friend declarations of nested classes to prevent compile
	  problems under VS6.0

2005-10-26 20:00  robert

	* Changed the minimum tile image size to be 4x4 to avoid problems
	  in mipmap generation
	  that was occuring at sizes of 2x2, seemingly somewhere in the
	  OpenGL driver.

2005-10-26 16:02  robert

	* From Bob Kuehne, "changed two set methods
	  (setFocalLength,setFieldOfView) to perform
	  assignment."

2005-10-26 09:22  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, compile fixes for VS6.0

2005-10-25 18:34  robert

	* Updated wrappers

2005-10-25 15:49  robert

	* Added command line support for the interlaced stereo modes.

2005-10-25 15:43  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari & Robert Osfield: Added support for
	  VERTICAL_INTERLACE and HORIZONTAL_INTERLACE
	  stereo modes use the stencil buffer.

2005-10-25 14:01  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-25 13:28  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, added support for constrain delaunay
	  triangultion, and osgdelaunay example.

2005-10-25 13:24  robert

	* Added check against glGetString(GL_VERSION) returning NULL.

2005-10-25 10:30  robert

	* Added missing projects

2005-10-25 10:29  robert

	* Added osgcatch project

2005-10-25 10:12  robert

	* Added missing projects.

2005-10-25 09:54  robert

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, added meanigful return types in
	  Registry::read(const ReadFunctor& readFunctor) for
	  ERROR_IN_READING_FILE and
	  FILE_NOT_FOUND cases.

2005-10-25 09:49  robert

	* Added protected destructors.

2005-10-25 09:43  robert

	* From Don Tidrow, removed unncessary includes.

2005-10-25 09:23  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, changed osg_InverseViewMatrix to
	  osg_ViewMatrixInverse to bring
	  into line with OpenGL shader languague conventions.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, changed the SceneView::ActiveUnforms enum to
	  from INVERSE_VIEW_MATRIX_UNIFORM
	  VIEW_MATRIX_INVERSE_UNIFORM to be convistent with the above
	  change.

2005-10-24 18:51  robert

	* Changes to fix divide by 0 warning under VS.

2005-10-24 13:49  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-24 13:46  robert

	* Fixed compile warnings.

2005-10-24 11:46  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, "some fixes for OSG_OPTIMIZER envar parsing
	  and help display"

2005-10-24 11:44  robert

	* From Marco Jez, added missing example project files.

2005-10-24 11:37  robert

	* From Tony Horrobin:
	  
	  "This is a small fix for flt2osg.[cpp|h] that handles
	  old style road segments ( from Multigen II w/road
	  tools on IRIX ) in the same way as the newer road
	  constructions. ie create a group and do a nested
	  traversal.
	  
	  This makes roads appear in older format files where
	  there was previously a gap. This actually works
	  properly with the paths which are marked as hidden in
	  the openflight database."

2005-10-24 11:34  robert

	* From Don Tidrow, "I discovered that externally-referenced models
	  in the TXP format didn't
	  get positioned correctly when the TXP database was built using
	  the
	  'tile-offset' mode. I've included a tarball with what I believe
	  are the
	  needed changes - they work for the sample databases I have
	  available,
	  but not all conditions have been tested. I've set things up such
	  that
	  these changes shouldn't affect 'normal' txp databases."

2005-10-24 11:25  robert

	* Warning fixes for Win32 build.

2005-10-24 10:53  robert

	* Added copyright notices.

2005-10-24 10:51  robert

	* Added beginnings of Programming Guide, and NodeTrackerCallback.

2005-10-14 21:40  robert

	* From Farshid Lashkari, compile fix for VS 2002.

2005-10-14 21:38  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, fixed INVERSE_VIEW_MATRIX_UNIFORM enum
	  value.

2005-10-14 09:29  robert

	* From Farshid Laskari, changed the compute of the text bounding
	  box to include the spaces.

2005-10-13 12:51  robert

	* Renamed osgUtil::RenderGraph to osgUtil::StateGraph

2005-10-13 10:29  robert

	* Changed the "Cessna" text so that it is sized according to
	  OBJECT_COORDS rather
	  than SCREEN_COORDS as the later was causing problems with the
	  pixel size based LOD selection.

2005-10-13 08:18  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-10-13 08:07  robert

	* Added Producer.lib to osgdepthpartion project file

2005-10-13 08:05  robert

	* Added PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes make options to the unix build
	  system, not defining
	  PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes or setting it to another value than yes
	  (i.e no) will result
	  in the osgProducer library, OSG applications and demos not being
	  built.
	  
	  PRODUCER_INSTALLED=yes is the default.

2005-10-12 18:42  robert

	* Added SmokeTrailEffect which renders created particles as single
	  quad or line
	  strip, in the case of the quad strip the strip is aligned to the
	  be orthogonal with
	  the eye point.

2005-10-11 09:47  robert

	* Added new shell of new class ConnectedParticleSystem, which will
	  be used
	  for managing connect particle system for the purpose of doing
	  missile trails etc.

2005-10-10 10:10  robert

	* From Ravi Mathur, osgdepthpartition example program.

2005-10-10 09:17  robert

	* From Alberto Jaspe, added double precision interpolation method

2005-10-07 07:46  robert

	* Added into CVS missing PolgonMode files.

2005-10-06 20:02  robert

	* Improved the UpdateCameraAndTexGenCallback so it properly handles
	  rotation and
	  translations within the reflector nodepath.

2005-10-06 15:43  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, added support for PolygonMode into .ive
	  format.

2005-10-06 15:41  robert

	* Changed the fallback code to use the result form the realize()
	  call, removed
	  the code path from running a PBuffer as a seperate graphics
	  context (this
	  was found to be slower than running single threaded so its not
	  worth the
	  extra complexity).

2005-10-06 13:31  robert

	* Added env var reporting for the OSG_CAMERA_THREADING and
	  OSG_SHARE_GRAPHICS_CONTEXTS env vars.

2005-10-06 13:20  robert

	* Added catch for disabling ThreadPerCamera when contexts are
	  shared.

2005-10-06 11:26  robert

	* Improved the fallback mechanism from FBO, down to PBuffer_RTT
	  down to PBuffer down to frame buffer.

2005-10-05 16:21  robert

	* Moved the testing and setting up of FBO/Pbuffer extension from
	  CullVisitor to
	  support into RenderStage to allow better fallback
	  implementations.

2005-10-05 09:48  robert

	* Added support for CameraView into NodeVistor, and support for
	  CameraNode and CameraView
	  into the AnimationPathCallback so you can now animate both via
	  animation paths.

2005-10-04 18:50  robert

	* Added code paths for PBuffer RTT support.

2005-10-04 13:41  robert

	* Added osg::CameraView to help application/modellers position
	  their cameras in scenes. Note,
	  CameraView is *not* a camera, it isn't an active object, but a
	  passive one that
	  camera must track each frame to following the path of the
	  CameraView.

2005-10-03 19:37  robert

	* From Keith Steffen, fixed bug in StateSet::clear() where parents
	  of texture attributes
	  where not being reset correctly due to incorrect ordering of
	  _textureAttributeList.clear().

2005-10-03 19:33  robert

	* From MFM, Added FreeBSD specific implementation for
	  getGLExtensionFuncPtr using dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, xxx)

2005-10-03 19:24  robert

	* Added a couple of (double) casts for VS7 build.

2005-10-03 19:18  robert

	* Added closing of loops.

2005-10-03 16:13  robert

	* Added fusing of ends of lines

2005-10-03 13:19  robert

	* Improved handling of convex azim ranges.

2005-10-01 19:28  robert

	* Added test cases for SphereSegment intersection code.

2005-10-01 19:27  robert

	* Added a dirtyDisplayList() to the setColor() and
	  setTesselationHint() methods.

2005-10-01 12:23  robert

	* Adding handling of case of convex azimuth side ways of sphere
	  segment.

2005-09-30 19:36  robert

	* Changed the line intersection algorithm to computer full line
	  intersections then
	  trim down to size by intersecting with the sphere segmenet
	  sufaces

2005-09-29 15:55  robert

	* Fix to intersection code.

2005-09-29 13:07  robert

	* Updated wrappers.

2005-09-29 13:00  robert

	* From Marco Jez, fix for gcc build.

2005-09-29 10:25  robert

	* Fixed typo of Primitive

2005-09-29 10:22  robert

	* Added setOverlayClearColor and setTexEnvMode and automatic set up
	  of TexEnv.

2005-09-29 09:49  robert

	* From Marco Jez, added fallback to TextureCubeMap subloading that
	  calls load
	  when mipmaps are required, but non are present.

2005-09-29 09:36  robert

	* Fixed typo of CameraNode::setRenderTargetImplementation(..)

2005-09-28 16:05  robert

	* From Volker Walkiewicz (with tweaks from Robert Osfield):
	  
	  Fix to the update of the error metrics on the edges in the
	  simplification mesh that are affected by an edge collapse.
	  
	  Addition of 'n' and 'p' keyboard control in osgsimplifier example
	  to allow users to control the sample ratio manually.

2005-09-28 14:18  robert

	* From Marco Jez, "Problems fixed:
	  
	  1. type converters created automatically by the I_BaseType macro
	  use
	  static_cast<> even for base-to-derived conversions.
	  dynamic_cast<> should be
	  used instead.
	  2. as a consequence of the above fix, I_BaseType must now
	  differentiate
	  between polymorphic and non-polymorphic base classes, because the
	  latter
	  can't be dynamic_cast'd to derived classes. Some template magic
	  (see
	  is_polymorphic<> in ReflectionMacros) is used to detect
	  polymorphism at
	  compile time (I'm NOT sure it works on all platforms as it's
	  partly
	  implementation-dependent. Please test!).
	  3. predefined custom property getters/setters/counters/etc. (as
	  those
	  defined for STL containers) only work on Value objects that
	  contain
	  non-pointer instances. This was an unwanted restriction that no
	  longer
	  exists.
	  
	  Wrappers will need to be recompiled. This is a good time to give
	  them a
	  fresh update with genwrapper.
	  
	  NOTE: fix #1 should get rid of those crashes and strange
	  behaviours that
	  some users noticed while using osgIntrospection through osgTcl or
	  in their
	  own code."

2005-09-28 14:05  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, "The following files are drop-in replacements
	  for the include/*/Export files to permit
	  building statically linked osg libraries under Win32."

2005-09-28 13:55  robert

	* From Leandro Motta Barros: fixed type of ATTRIBUTE_*

2005-09-28 13:53  robert

	* From A. Botorabi, "slightly modified osgUtil's
	  TangentSpaceGenerator class to allow the
	  option for using or not using geom's indices for tangent space
	  vectors
	  generation. now, Ruben's code is also used (it was disabled
	  before). in
	  order to keep backward compatibility, the compute method behaves
	  as before
	  in default case."

2005-09-28 13:45  robert

	* From Joran Jessurun, comments explaining font search rules

2005-09-28 13:39  robert

	* From Joran Jessurun, added font search fallbck that strips the
	  leading path from the font file and then looks again.

2005-09-28 13:33  robert

	* From Chris Hanson:
	  
	  Spelling fixes in include/osg/LOD
	  
	  Negated priority in PagedLOD when using
	  _rangeMode==PIXEL_SIZE_ON_SCREEN
	  
	  Added clampedPixelSize() methods to CullStack and CullingSet to
	  return fabs()ed values.
	  
	  Changed LOD and PagedLOD ::traverse to use clampedPixelSize()
	  methods.

2005-09-27 20:28  robert

	* Added degugging methods.

2005-09-27 14:48  robert

	* From Don Tidrow, Added support for locally referenced origins.

2005-09-27 12:15  robert

	* Various improvements to the sphere segment intersection code.

2005-09-26 11:24  robert

2005-09-26 11:24  robert

	* Added TexEnv DECAL mode.

2005-09-25 20:41  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, fixes from VS 7.1 build.

2005-09-24 16:11  don

	* Brede's changes for limited morphed vertex support. These changes
	  allow
	  a model with morphed vertecies to load correctly with LOD
	  switches, but
	  does not implement the vertex morphing.

2005-09-24 14:53  robert

	* Improvements to the clipping of polygons at boundary edges.

2005-09-21 14:38  robert

	* Further work on intersection code.

2005-09-19 19:49  robert

	* Added multiple intersect triangle visualization for testing
	  purposes.

2005-09-19 15:33  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen: support for OSGHANGGLIDE_REVERSE_CONTROLS env
	  which reverses
	  the pitch and roll control to account from Mike's "unique" way of
	  flying hang gliders :-)

2005-09-19 15:28  robert

	* From Ravi Mathur, added extension checks for point sprite

	  files that only had partial colour palettes
	  
	  Which are typically found in older 14.x files and file converted
	  through Polytrans or Deep exploration etc.
	  
	  The code that grabs the color entries in
	  ConvertFromFLT::visitColorPalette was assuming that there were
	  full
	  palettes always coming in and stepping was out of bounds in
	  certain cases (not all) and thus crashing with
	  access violations etc,
	  
	  Although the normal from Creator is to have 1024 or 512 entries ,
	  this is not a really requirement of the format, just the way
	  Creator creates its default palettes etc.
	  
	  Code changed to look at the number of entries and use just those
	  and fills in any missing entries with a default white colour"

	  point.
	  I also removed calculateUpperLowerBBCorners() from the
	  Plane(const
	  Vec3& v1, const Vec3& v2, const Vec3& v3) since the constructor
	  is
	  using the function set(const Vec3& v1, const Vec3& v2, const
	  Vec3& v3)
	  which already computes the upper and lower bounding box."

	  "I add a new option in the HDR Reader.
	  
	  The RAW option store the RGBE values into a Image, to use
	  this option you need to decode the RGBE value in the frag-
	  ment shader. Follow the cube map glsl decoder:
	  
	  vec4 textureCubeRGBE( uniform samplerCube sampler, vec3 coords )
	  {
	  ivec4 rgbe = textureCube( sampler, coords ) * 255. + 0.5;
	  float e = rgbe.a - ( 128 + 8 );
	  return vec4( rgbe.rgb * exp2( e ), 1.0 );
	  }
	  
	  This option is usefull for who have a outdate hardware like
	  FX cards and want to do cool things.
	  
	  Finally this patch is need by a new HDR Rendering example
	  that I will put on the Wiki."

	  "My patch is a slight refactoring of the mac specific code in
	  Registry.cpp and FileUtils.cpp, specifically around the library
	  and
	  resource file path initilialization methods. This patch cleans up
	  a
	  lot of the mac specific code by moving repeated code into
	  separate
	  local functions in FileUtils.cpp that are only compiled on mac
	  builds.
	  It also adds one function to the API,
	  appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in FileUtils. This
	  function
	  will mirror the already existing
	  appendPlatformSpecificLibraryFilePaths except for resource file
	  paths.
	  Currently this function is empty except when built on the mac, in
	  which case it will add the application bundle's internal
	  Resources
	  folder and the bundle's parent folder. Previously this code was
	  implemented as a separate mac specific #ifdef block in
	  Registry.cpp
	  around the initDataFilePathList method. However, it now is
	  implemented
	  in appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in FileUtils.cpp and
	  the
	  initDataFilePathList method is now the same on all platforms.
	  This
	  patch should behave the same as before on non-mac platforms.
	  
	  This patch already includes the fix that Eric mentioned earlier.
	  This
	  patch is based off of the 0.99 release code. I have tested this
	  patch
	  using the following testing scheme:
	  
	  Make a proper bundled application.
	  While Run from the Finder:
	  Test that it finds plugins in its internal plugins path.
	  Test that it finds resources in its internal resources path.
	  Test that it finds resources in the bundle's parent directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the user's Application Support
	  Directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the system's Application Support
	  Directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the Network Application Support
	  Directory
	  Check the plugin and resource path lists after they have been
	  initialized to see if they are in the correct order
	  
	  While Run from the command line (both from it's parent directory
	  and
	  from inside the /Contents/MacOS directory) and repeat the above
	  tests.
	  Check that it also finds plugins and resources within the paths
	  defined by various environment variables.
	  
	  Now, Make an application that is NOT bundled/command line only
	  Test that it does NOT try to look in an internal bundle
	  plugin/resource directory for plugins or resources.
	  Test that it finds plugins/resources in the paths defined by the
	  environment variables.

2005-06-28 17:53  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, icon file.

2005-06-28 09:34  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, "some polish for 1.0: centralizes the icon
	  resource definition and adjusts all
	  app and example projects to use that single defn. The various
	  existing
	  resources.rc files should be deleted."

2005-06-27 14:28  robert

	* Added / and * controls of the distance attentuations of the point

	* From David Spilling, fixed the incircle test so it handles

2005-06-24 19:50  robert

	* From Colin McDonald,
	  "On fixing the pointer access I discovered that reading osga
	  archives
	  containing ive files went into a cpu loop. This turned out to be
	  a
	  problem with proxy_streambuf on Solaris. Public methods in the
	  Solaris
	  streambuf standard library implementation rely on the gptr()
	  being set,
	  which proxy_streambuf was not doing. So I have modified
	  proxy_streambuf to set the input sequence pointers, and have also
	  aligned it more with the standard library streambuf
	  implementation
	  where all input is through underflow(), not uflow() which merely
	  calls
	  underflow() and advances the pointer."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, change from using pointer cast and
	  assignment to using
	  a templated _write and _read method to avoid pointer aliasing to
	  2/4/8
	  byte boundaries that some computer system may produce. These
	  changes
	  where inspried by Colin McDonalds change to using memcpy, these
	  changes weren't merged as memcpy is not as clear in naming as
	  _read,
	  _write and memcpy will incurr a function call just for copy a
	  uint.

2005-06-24 15:39  robert

	* From Colin McDonald:
	  
	  "Some makedefs fixes for Solaris:
	  
	  For multithreaded applications the -mt option must be specified
	  on both
	  the compile and link steps, to ensure correct behaviour.
	  According to
	  the Sun compiler documentation it sets REENTRANT flags in the
	  system
	  header files, and links the -lthread library in the correct
	  order.
	  
	  When compiling shared libraries the -KPIC option should be
	  specified.
	  Although Solaris will handle shared libraries without
	  position-independent code there is a performance penalty. The
	  linker
	  reference manual says: 'If a shared object is built from code
	  that is
	  not position-independent, the text segment will usually require a
	  large
	  number of relocations to be performed at runtime. Although the
	  runtime
	  linker is equipped to handle this, the system overhead this
	  creates can
	  cause serious performance degradation'."

2005-06-24 15:34  robert

	* From Martijn Kragtwijk: "I ran into the same problems as Karl
	  Martensson
	  (http://openscenegraph.org/archiver/osg-users/2005-June/0575.html);
	  after switching children of a Switch node off and on again, they
	  become
	  unpickable. This issue occurs first in 0.9.9, with 0.9.8
	  everything is fine.
	  My fix involves calling dirtyBound() every time the on/off-values
	  of the
	  Switch are changed"

2005-06-24 15:30  robert

	* From David Guthrie, "The call NSLookupAndBindSymbol was changed
	  to
	  NSLookupSymbolInModule. The former call would lookup the named
	  symbol NOT in the current dynamic library, but in the entire
	  running
	  program while the call NSLookupSymbolInModule, takes the handle
	  to
	  the library the symbol should be found in. This means the current
	  code will fail if one loads multiple bundles at runtime and
	  attempts
	  to load the same named symbol from each one."

2005-06-24 15:15  robert

	* Moved the working createPagedLODScene() implemention into
	  createScene()
	  method replacing the original flaky code.

2005-06-22 11:26  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, fixes to shaders to correct modification of
	  varying types

2005-06-22 11:02  robert

	* Disabled NPO2T on GeforceFX.

2005-06-22 11:01  robert

	  shader program
	  to create an animated parametric surface.

2005-06-20 10:38  robert

	* From Tom Jolly, added method for getting the number of frames.

2005-06-20 10:36  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen,
	  " - adjustments to improve namespacing on VS
	  - clarify compilation status message"

2005-06-20 10:28  robert

	* From Andreas Jochens (submitted by Loic Dachary), addintion of
	  forward declare
	  of class Progam; to fix compile problem under gcc4.0/amd64/debian
	  unstable.

2005-06-20 10:16  robert

2005-06-15 20:06  robert

	* Futher work on FBO support

2005-06-15 20:05  robert

	* Added automatic creation of texture when size is set but not
	  osg::Image is assigned.
	  This is useful for FBO usage.

2005-06-15 11:49  robert

	* From David Guthrie, " In the constructor
	  in removes any options beginning with "-psn" from argv on OSX by
	  calling the "remove" method. When a .app run is created in OSX,
	  which is required to get a fully functioning UI application, the
	  OSX
	  finder passes a -psn_XXXX option to the application where the
	  XXXX
	  refers to a unique process number. An example option would be "-
	  psn_0_37617665". The argument parser was choking on this option
	  in
	  all the osg example applications."

2005-06-15 10:59  robert

	* Added osgmultiplecameras example and support for pre/post
	  multiplaction.

2005-06-14 20:51  robert

	* Work on the RenderToTexture usage of the new osg::CameraNode.
	  Both osghud

2005-06-14 13:16  robert

	* Added osg::CameraNode.

	* Fixed position of glBindBuffer.

2005-06-13 20:03  robert

	* Fixed with the reprojection so that it doesn't promote all source
	  data to
	  RGBA, but only does this for RGB data.

2005-06-13 11:14  robert

	* From Ken Sewell, fixed for x86_64 build.

2005-06-09 19:02  robert

	  osg::Obejct
	  base class

2005-06-08 10:39  robert

	* Added sizeof(std::string) test to osgunittests

2005-06-08 10:36  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, added GLSL datatypes mat2 and mat3 to
	  osg::Uniform, with .osg and .ive support

2005-06-08 08:33  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, "modified .rot pseudoloader plugin so rotation
	  order actually matches the embedded documentation"

2005-06-06 10:18  robert

	* From Mathia Walker: bug fix to LOD ranges in TXP plugin to avoid
	  cracks:
	  
	  "I took a closer look at the conditional code in
	  SeamFinder::seamReplacement().
	  
	  Because _info.minRange is a double and lod->getMinRange(0) is a
	  float,
	  the difference will be calculated with double precision. If
	  _info.minRange is cast as a float it is exactly the same value as
	  lod->getMinRange(0) and the difference is exactly zero.
	  
	  So if you change
	  
	  
	  if((fabs(_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs(_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))
	  
	  to
	  
	  
	  if((fabs((float)_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs((float)_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))
	  
	  it works a lot better."

	* Changed VisualStudio 7.0 reference to 7.x

2005-06-05 18:40  robert

	* From Adam Richard, fixed typos + explanation how to use project
	  files.

2005-05-31 06:21  robert

	* From Tim Daust, "I fixed the getScale functions in matrixf and
	  matrixd. It was returning the values of the diagonal
	  of the matrix, which only returns the scale if there
	  is not a rotation. I fixed this by returning the
	  length of the vectors that form the basis.
	  I also added a function to orthonormalize the
	  rotation component of the matrix. I seem to always run
	  into situations where non uniform (or even uniform)
	  scale complicate my calculations, and I thought other
	  members of the community could use this function as
	  well."

2005-05-30 16:15  robert

	* Added support for reading:
	  
	  OSG_MINIMUM_COMPILE_TIME_PER_FRAME <float>
	  
	  and
	  
	  OSG_MAXIMUM_OBJECTS_TO_COMPILE_PER_FRAME <int>
	  
	  environmental variable during the initialization of the
	  DatabasePager
	  to allow apps to be tweaked for best database pager behavior.

	* From Joson Daly, fix for forward/backward/swing animation
	  handling both 15.8 and
	  versions prior to 15.8, and...
	  
	  " Here's another fix for OpenFlight. The symptom was that ATTR
	  files were
	  not being read correctly, and the TexEnv on a texture that should
	  have
	  been set to DECAL was instead defaulting to MODULATE. The cause
	  is that
	  the ATTR reader cannot tell by itself what version it's reading
	  (the
	  version information isn't present in the ATTR files), and instead
	  relies
	  on the ReaderWriter::Options passed in to get the OpenFlight
	  version.
	  
	  My change clones the current ReaderWriter::Options and prepends
	  the
	  appropriate FLT_VER option before the ReaderWriterATTR object is
	  called. I also made the parsing of the FLT_VER string and value
	  more
	  robust in the ReaderWriterATTR itself. I think I commented things
	  OK,
	  but let me know if you need me to explain anything."

	* From Alberto Farre, nested files bug fix.

2005-04-04 11:18  robert

	* From Alberto Farre:
	  "Here there are fixes for several flt loader problems.
	  
	  First one was an small bug when root database was an empty string
	  we got a database path "/" instead of "./".
	  Second one is more complex. Flt loader works in two passes, first
	  one reads flt database and second one builds osg scenegraph.
	  Special care must be taken for properly tracking database path as
	  nested files are entered. Because textures are loaded in second
	  pass, mentioned care should be taken once again. I wrote time ago
	  a piece of code and I placed it in both files fltFile.cpp and
	  flt2osg.cpp. After a long period offline I have seen the portion
	  of code at flt2osg was missing, I just made some tests and I
	  could see it is still required.
	  
	  Finally, I have seen that pool.cpp always try to make IMAGE cache
	  instead of reading what Options says.
	  
	  Aditonally, I recently wrote an osg change, now it has external
	  references "a la flt" what is called osg::ProxyNode. As part of
	  the change now flt loader builds external references as
	  ProxyNodes. I made the same mistake like pool.cpp and always made
	  ARCHIVE cache instead of see what Options says, it has also been
	  fixed."

	* From Ruben, added handling of vertex indices.
	  
	  Note from Robert. New codes produces errors when running
	  osgfxbrowser cow.osg so I have elected to keep the original
	  implementation of compute_basis_vectors around and as the default
	  compile to keep the CVS version working. Ruben's new version
	  of compute_basis_vectors has to be explicitly compiled in by
	  toggling an #if 1 block to #if 0.

2005-03-07 12:14  robert

	* From Marco Jez, "Current version of the LWO plugin creates one
	  Geode with a single Geometry
	  for each Lighwave surface, in order to keep surface names
	  (geometries can't
	  have names). The attached fix adds a plugin option named
	  "COMBINE_GEODES"
	  that allows to place all geometries under a single Geode whenever
	  possible,
	  thus offering better chances of further optimization through
	  osgUtil::Optimizer. The downside is that surface names are no
	  longer stored
	  in the scene graph when using this option."

	* Made Referenced::ref() and unref() inline methods.

2005-02-22 20:56  robert

	* Removed the default play() in the MPEG, QuickTime and Xine
	  plugins, moving
	  it into the osgmovie application, and into readNodeFile method
	  where
	  --movie is now available for detecting movie code.

	  create
	  a random size, color, and alpha."

2004-05-09 07:06  robert

	* From Joran Jessurun, "I needed to be able to set the quality of
	  the saved jpeg images. I could
	  not find a way to do this in OSG. Therefore I implemented this by
	  adding
	  an option called: JPEG_QUALITY <quality> to the JPEG
	  reader/writer.
	  
	  To parse the options string I use the same method as used in the
	  LWO
	  reader/writer. "

2004-05-09 06:29  robert

	* From Mike Weiblen, Fixes for Win32 build

2004-05-08 22:18  robert

	* From Corbin Holtz, "I have completed my mods to the OpenFlight
	  loader (modified files are
	  attached):
	  * Light point strings using the REPLICATE opcode should now be
	  supported
	  (>=15.6?)
	  
	  * Directional lights should now work as in Performer using a
	  viewing
	  frustrum defined by a direction vector, horizontal angular width,
	  vertical
	  angular width, and roll angle about the direction vector. The
	  current
	  directional light implementation had some bad assumptions which
	  caused
	  problems with direction vectors not on the XY plane.
	  
	  * IVE and OSG reader/writers were updated as appropriate"

2004-05-08 21:33  robert

	* From Paul Martz,
	  
	  "Changes to provide rudimentary support for OF 15.8 light point
	  animation palettes. This change also includes light point palette
	  override
	  support for external references. This is the last of my code
	  changes to
	  support OF 15.8 in the flt loader. Barring bugs, of course, knock
	  on wood.
	  
	  The gist of the animation palette code is to create ref_ptr'd
	  osgSim::BlinkSequence objects for each palette entry, and then
	  pass them on
	  to osgSim::LightPoint for any OpenFlight light points that
	  reference that
	  palette entry. This should be conservative of memory (not that I
	  expect the
	  animation palette to be extremely large)."

2004-05-08 18:41  don

	* Ooops... previous fix didn't work, corrected.

2004-05-08 18:37  don

	  the .osg
	  and .ive formats.

2004-05-02 15:45  robert

	* Made the tri stripping of tile default to using a minimum tri
	  strip length
	  of 3, thereby reducing the number of indivual primitives, but
	  with the tradeoff
	  of more seperate triangles being used.

2004-05-02 15:43  robert

	* Made the generation of QUADS for strip with the length of 4 an

	* Added defaults for the geotransform when none exists.

2004-03-17 20:34  robert

	* From Paul Martz, "The attached code change causes the flt plugin
	  to leave _sector unset if the
	  direction normal has a zero length. The net effect is that
	  unidirectional
	  light points with zero length direction vectors are now treated
	  as
	  omnidirectional light points."

	* From Paul Marz : "Input.h, Input.cpp -- Here's where support for
	  reading the continuation
	  record goes. I added a new function to read a continued record
	  body. I added
	  code in the existing ReadRecord routine to peek ahead for a
	  CONTINUATION_OP
	  if the current record could possibly be continued.
	  
	  opcodes.h -- Besides adding the opcode for CONTINUATION_OP, I
	  also added new
	  15.8 opcodes. I labeled opcodes as "ignored" if I could easily
	  discern that
	  our loader wasn't doing anything with them. For historical
	  reasons, I added
	  all obsolete opcodes, prefixed with "OBS_".
	  
	  LocalVertexPoolRecord.h, LocalVertexPoolRecord.cpp -- This is one
	  of three
	  types of records that can be continued with a CONTINUATION_OP
	  record. I
	  removed all invalid assertions that assumed the record length
	  would always
	  be less than 65535. I replaced the "vertex size" calculation with
	  a more
	  efficient method based on caching the size from attribute bits,
	  rather than
	  taking the length of the record and dividing it by numVerts
	  (which would
	  have been incorrect if the record had been continued)."

2004-03-06 14:38  robert

	* Added osg.ico back in again to test out cvs's assignment of
	  keyword

2004-03-05 15:44  robert

	* From Marco Jez, on behalf of Farshid Lashkari. Details from
	  Marco's email: "I've just received an addition to osgParticle
	  from Farshid Lashkari. It enhances the generation of texture
	  coordinates on particles so that animated textures can be used,
	  with the current frame of animation being computed from each
	  particle's current age.
	  Clients just have to call Particle::setTextureTile() and specify
	  the number of
	  horizontal and vertical tiles that make the animation up in the
	  texture image."

2004-03-04 18:35  robert

	  "Changes to return the lat/long origin of an
	  OpenFlight model as userData of the root node object."

2004-03-02 15:37  robert

	* From Paul Martz:
	  
	  "These two files fix the alignment bug in the flt plugin header
	  parsing, which I posted about on Saturday. They go in the flt
	  plugin
	  directory.
	  
	  The fix is to memcpy the data read from the flt file into
	  individual fields
	  in our Header struct, then replace the raw (packed) data block
	  with our
	  header struct. This avoids the alignment problem entirely, and
	  all fields
	  now contain valid data."

2004-03-02 15:27  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen: added _matrixDirty=true to

	  environmental
	  variable in the computeFastPathsUsed() method so that use of
	  vertex arrays
	  can be forced off. This is a work around for a bug in the OpenGL
	  drivers in
	  OSX/Panther.

	  then cull then draw. Added missing copy of update callback into
	  copy
	  constructor.

2003-12-15 23:23  robert

	* Added support for updating the SceneView projection matrix from
	  the values
	  of near and far computed during the cull traversal.

2003-12-15 23:22  robert

	* Changed the default wrap modes from REPEAT to CLAMP since CLAMP
	  is the OpenGL
	  default value.

2003-12-15 16:46  robert

	* Added two news examples, osgsimple just loads a model and then
	  renders it in
	  a single window. osgkeyboardmouse adds to osgsimple support for
	  keyboard mouse
	  and picking interactions.

2003-12-15 16:40  robert

	* Added gemetry of photo album and page turning animation.

	  support
	  for Registry::closeAllLibrary and forced Registry destruction via
	  Registry::instance(true).

2003-12-13 15:33  robert

	* From Eric Sokolosky, fixed broken handling of palatted textures.

2003-12-12 20:33  robert

	* Fixed typo of s/getUpdateVisitor().

	* Fixed flatten static transform

2003-12-12 16:34  robert

	* Removed comments, and move the tri stipper slightly later in the
	  code to
	  apply it on all geometries.

2003-12-12 15:22  robert

	* Updates from Geof Michel.

2003-12-12 13:53  robert

	* Made progress reports use osg::notify(osg::INFO) instread of
	  std::cout

2003-12-12 13:24  robert

	* Fixed merging of geometry code.

2003-12-11 23:33  robert

	* Renamed PermissableOptions to setPermissableOptimizations.

2003-12-11 23:26  robert

	* Added support for controlling what optimization operations can be
	  applied
	  to specific nodes in the scene graph. Typical use would be
	  tagging a
	  node so that it can't be optimized away in say a flatten static
	  transform
	  pass. Added methods to Optimizer are:
	  
	  inline void setPermissableOptionsForObject(const osg::Object*
	  object, unsigned int options)
	  {
	  _permissableOptionsMap[object] = options;
	  }
	  
	  inline unsigned int getPermissableOptionsForObject(const
	  osg::Object* object) const
	  {
	  PermissableOptionsMap::const_iterator itr =
	  _permissableOptionsMap.find(object);
	  if (itr!=_permissableOptionsMap.end()) return itr->second;
	  else return 0xffffffff;
	  }
	  
	  inline bool isOperationPermissableForObject(const osg::Object*
	  object,unsigned int option) const
	  {

	  }

2003-12-11 16:46  robert

	* Added _maximumNumberOfActiveOccluders variable to
	  CollectOccludersVisitor(), to
	  limit the maximum number of occluders used in the cull traversal,
	  default is
	  now 10.
	  
	  Added set/getCollectOccluderVisitor() method into SceneView to
	  allow control
	  of the the settings of the CollectOccluderVisitor.

2003-12-10 16:50  robert

	* Added environmental variable for setting the height of the drive
	  manipulator.

2003-12-10 15:24  robert

	* Added a special AvailablerReaderWriterIterator class to handle
	  the task
	  of iterating through the list of available reader writer, whilst
	  handling
	  cases where the list itself changes size during iteration through
	  the list.
	  Previous size changes during iteration was cause invalid
	  iterators, which
	  in turn was causing a crash.

2003-12-10 15:22  robert

	* Added proper handling of unhandled file return type.

2003-12-10 11:40  robert

	* Improved the management of errors reported from ReaderWriters,
	  and cleaned
	  up the reporting of errors in DynamicLibrary.

2003-12-10 10:49  robert

	* Added support for using DrawArrays when indices are in ascending
	  order, and
	  increment 1 at a time.

2003-12-09 22:29  robert

	* Improvements to the TriStripVisitor such that it now groups 4
	  point tri strips
	  together as quads.

2003-12-09 14:07  robert

	* Removed osg::Transform::ComputeTransformCallback from
	  osg::Transform.
	  
	  Updated various dependant files to reimplemt callbacks as
	  Transform subclasses.

2003-12-09 14:06  robert

	* Added support for new PagedLOD Radius and
	  NumChildrenThatCannorBeExpired variables
	  to .osg and .ive support.

2003-12-09 12:11  robert

	* Added new example osgphotoalbum.

2003-12-09 12:09  robert

	* Reverted back to non exception based JPEG plugin.

2003-12-09 12:08  robert

	* Addition of the following methods:
	  
	  /** Set the object-space reference radius of the volume enclosed
	  by the PagedLOD.
	  * Used to detmine the bounding sphere of the PagedLOD in the
	  absense of any children.*/
	  inline void setRadius(float radius) { _radius = radius; }
	  
	  /** Get the object-space radius of the volume enclosed by the
	  PagedLOD.*/
	  inline float getRadius() const { return _radius; }
	  
	  
	  /** Set the number of children that the PagedLOD must keep
	  around, even if thay are older than their expiry time.*/
	  inline void setNumChildrenThatCannotBeExpired(unsigned int num) {
	  _numChildrenThatCannotBeExpired = num; }
	  
	  /** Get the number of children that the PagedLOD must keep
	  around, even if thay are older than their expiry time.*/
	  unsigned int getNumChildrenThatCannotBeExpired() const { return
	  _numChildrenThatCannotBeExpired; }

2003-12-09 12:07  robert

	* Added get() method to ReaderWriterProxy class to allow the
	  readerwriter to
	  be obtained once its constructed.

2003-12-09 12:05  robert

	* Addition of Mode mode=MODULATE constructor.

2003-12-09 12:04  robert

	* Fixes for optional compile of GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA and GL_ALPHA
	  texture usage
	  in fonts. Default to GL_ALPHA.

2003-12-09 11:31  robert

	* Moved osgText across to create GL_ALPHA textures instead of
	  GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA

2003-12-09 11:20  robert

	* From Pavel Moloshtan, extension support for ARB_occlusion_querry

	  .osg file.
	  Includes a small modication to ensure that code works shared
	  animation paths, by RO.

2003-12-09 09:25  robert

	* From Eric Sokolosky, OSX uses DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for initial
	  library search path
	  instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2003-12-09 09:03  robert

	* Aded FileUtils include.

2003-12-08 19:25  robert

	* Added commented out lines for setting orange blue anaglyphic
	  stereo. The
	  analgyphic block really needs to have the color mask set up
	  optionally, this
	  is something to configure in the future.

2003-12-08 11:24  robert

	* Moved the responsibility for finding file to load on to the
	  ReaderWriter plugins,
	  instead of osgDB::Registry where it original lay. This has been
	  done to allow
	  fileName strings to be encode data rather than just file names,
	  such as one
	  requires when using PagedLOD along with plugins for doing dynamic
	  tesselation.

2003-12-07 20:58  robert

	* Added check against null being passed into std::string
	  constructor.

	* Added optional TraversalMask paramter to computeIntersections()
	  methods.

2003-12-03 21:45  robert

	* Implemented duplicate removal code into TriStripVisitor and added
	  an
	  extra pass to doing tri stripping in the osgUtil::Optimzer.
	  
	  Added validity checks into osg::TexEnvCombine to catch eronous
	  enumarant values.
	  
	  Improved the efficient of CullingSet's handling of new
	  transforms.
	  
	  Added a copy shared subgraphs and subdivision code into
	  osgUtil::Optimizer.

2003-12-03 21:28  robert

	* Made removedExpiredChildren() virtual.

2003-12-02 21:38  robert

	* Suggestion from Tree, changed tex coord scaling against
	  textureWidth/Height rather
	  than textureWidth-1 etc.

2003-12-02 21:38  robert

	* From Rune, Added catch for erroneous size specification in .dds
	  file.

2003-12-01 14:31  robert

	* From Pavel Moloshton, addition of AlphaFunc support to .ive.

2003-12-01 10:28  robert

	* Added a spatializer into osgUtil to create a balanced quad/oct
	  tree.

2003-11-28 22:39  robert

	* From Ruben,
	  
	  >Fixed: The iv loader that uses Inventor library has a little
	  bug, if used with
	  >osgconv, it doesn't write the images to the converted file
	  because it's
	  >not setting the osg::Image->setFilename()

2003-11-28 14:37  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, updates to GEO plugin.

2003-11-28 14:26  robert

	* Updates to osgdem.

2003-11-28 13:41  robert

	* From Rune Schmidt Jensen, support for osgSim::VisibilityGroup in
	  the .ive loader
	  and support for node masks.

2003-11-27 22:06  robert

	* Standardised the tabbing so that 4 spaces are used instead of
	  hardware tabs.

2003-11-27 16:23  robert

	* From Michael Gronager, osgSim::VisibilityGroup

2003-11-27 15:13  robert

	* Updates to osgdem + BoundingBox to support graph iterators

	* From Trajce Nikolov:
	  
	  > There are databases that contain both Matrix and GeneralMatrix
	  records as
	  > ancillary records. If this happens, this fix will only use one
	  matrix to
	  > create osg::TransformMatrix node.

2003-11-26 16:56  robert

	* Addition of light point.

	* From Trajce Nicklov, support for GeneralMatrix record

2003-11-25 10:32  robert

	* From Alberto Farre, added support for nesting of files.

2003-11-25 10:20  robert

	* From Michael Morrison, added support for the OpenFlight
	  BSPRecord, simply
	  mapping it to a Group.

2003-11-25 09:23  robert

	* Updated links to mailing list

2003-11-25 09:04  robert

	* Added support for case insenstive searches of the filepaths.

2003-11-24 10:01  robert

	* Changed the shadow colour so that it is now controlled via the
	  emissive
	  light material rather than ambient, this allows it to bypass any
	  of the
	  osg::Light values and control the resulting shadow colour more
	  directly.

2003-11-21 20:21  robert

	* Removed the ScalarBar:: from the from of the
	  ScalarPrinter::printScalar() calls.

	  additions
	  of handling of different extensions in ReaderWriterQT.cpp

2003-11-21 16:19  robert

	* Removed newline from top of header

2003-11-21 14:30  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, with mods by Robert to keep old code in
	  place, change to replace
	  scaling of texture since the OSG does this automatically when
	  required.

2003-11-21 14:17  robert

	* Changed the main to create a Group and then add the loaded scene
	  and HUD scene
	  into this. This has been done to rework code nearer to what
	  Stephan Huber
	  used to get round a crash under OSX when a model was passed in.
	  This crash
	  suggest a problem in dynamic_cast<> perhaps?

2003-11-21 13:45  robert

	* From Romano J M Silva, changed osg::Texture2D::copyTexImage2D so
	  that it uses the
	  _internalFormat for the texture format to read rather than
	  default to GL_RGBA.
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, changed the osg::Texture2D::copyTexImage2D
	  and copyTexSubImage
	  code so that it set the _internalFormat to GL_RGBA if is is zero.

2003-11-20 12:03  robert

	* Added the missing insertChild(index,child) and
	  insertChild(index,child,value) into
	  osg::Switch.

2003-11-20 11:07  robert

	* Changed the freetype plugin so it keeps its own ref_ptr<Font> to
	  fonts
	  that it creates, rather than have osgText::Font::readFontFile()
	  use the
	  osgDB::Registry object cache.
	  
	  This has been done to prevent problems when users flush the
	  object cache,
	  which was causing a dangling pointer.

2003-11-19 20:30  robert

	* Changed libgdal.lib to gdal.lib

2003-11-14 13:39  robert

	* From Ruben, added support for nested update and cull callbacks.

2003-11-14 09:25  robert

	* Changed the credit from NVidia's NvTriStrip to Tanguy Faure's
	  traingulation code.

2003-11-13 15:45  robert

	* From Tom Jolly, Fix to handling of triangle fans.

2003-11-12 19:05  robert

	* Added usage of object cache + fixed handling of projection

	  setColorIndices.
	  
	  Added support for triangle fan primitives.

2003-11-11 08:52  robert

	* From Dean Iversion, fix to the ReaderWriter::Options management
	  in Pool.cpp

2003-11-07 09:00  robert

	* Made getWidth and getHeight const.

2003-11-06 22:06  robert

	* From Sondra Iverson:
	  
	  small optimization to ParticleSystem.cpp moving sqrtf out of
	  inner loop.
	  fix of copy and past error changing erronous cullTimes to
	  drawTimes.

2003-11-06 21:58  robert

	* Added Producer.lib into the dependancy list.

2003-11-06 13:44  robert

	  passing betwen
	  Manipulators, Producer and SceneView. Note, SceneView still uses
	  Matrix internally
	  so will depend on what is set as the default in
	  include/osg/Matrix.
	  
	  Added the ability to osgProducer::setDone/getDone(), kept done()
	  as the
	  method that the viewer main loop uses for detecting the exit

	* Fix for IRIX build.

2003-09-03 10:47  robert

	* Added a Matrix::value_type typedef'd trait into osg::Matrix,
	  defaulting its
	  value to float, and converted the internal code across to use
	  value_type. This
	  allows Matrix to be converted to use double's simply by change
	  the definition
	  of value_type. Added Matrix::glLoadlMatrix and
	  Matrix::glMultMatrix() to
	  help encapsulate the changes between float and double matrix
	  usage.

	  double matrices.

2003-09-02 20:39  robert

	* Merged changed to osgParticle from Marco Jez, the changes are
	  (quoted from
	  email from Marco)
	  
	  "Most relevant news:
	  1) particle systems now have the "freezeOnCull" property set to
	  false by
	  default. Since it is an optimization, and using it may cause some
	  unwanted
	  behaviors if not handled properly, it makes more sense to turn it
	  off by
	  default.
	  2) new "LINE" shape mode which uses GL_LINES to draw line
	  segments that
	  point to the direction of motion.
	  3) particles can now have a rotation angle and angular velocity.
	  4) new AngularAccelOperator applies angular acceleration to
	  particles.
	  5) particle processors such as emitters and programs can have a
	  "start",
	  "end" and "reset" time coordinate. For example, an emitter may be
	  instructed
	  to start emitting particles only after a certain time, stop after
	  another
	  amount of time and then start again.
	  
	  Update (2) is from Gideon May.
	  Updates (3) to (5) are from Douglas A. Pouk."

	  (double).
	  
	  Added osg::Matrixf::glLoadMatrix() and
	  osg::Matrixf::glMultiMatrix() methods
	  and changed corresponding usage of glLoad/MultMatrixf() calls
	  across to use these
	  methods. Again prep for support Matrixd.
	  
	  Fixes for VisualStudio 6.0 compile.

	* Various changes to the BUILD system:
	  
	  o Object files now go in subdirectories named $(OS)$(ARCH).Opt
	  and
	  $(OS)$(ARCH).Debug for OS's that support both architectures.
	  eg. Linux32.Opt and Linux32.Debug
	  
	  o Libraries links are now placed in lib/$(OS)$(ARCH)
	  eg. lib/Linux32/
	  
	  o Binaries are now placed in bin/$(OS)$(ARCH)
	  eg. bin/Linux32
	  
	  o 'make install' and 'make instlinks' now place files/links in
	  /usr/local/{include,lib,share/OpenSceneGraph} by default on
	  most systems (Solaris still goes in /opt/OpenSceneGraph).
	  Rather than having the somwehat confusing INST_SYS_PREFIX and
	  INST_SHARE_PREFX, you can override these with just
	  INST_LOCATION
	  For example,
	  make INST_LOCATION=/usr
	  will place files at /usr/include, /usr/lib,
	  /usr/share/OpenSceneGraph.

	  by osgUtil::RenderLeaf to test if any abort state has been set,
	  if so it
	  doesn't do any further drawing.
	  
	  The osgProducer::Viewer has been set up to set the osg::State's
	  it manages
	  with their AbortRendering flag pointers set to the
	  osgProducer::Viewer::_done
	  memeber varaible. Now when escape is pressed the rendering is
	  aborted early.

2003-03-11 13:30  robert

	* Bug fixes to osgText to handle the osgUtil::Optimizer being used

	  needs
	  the current model view or projection matrices.
	  
	  Changes osgreflect so that it uses ClipNode rather than clip
	  plane, thereby
	  fixing the problems which occur when the above is applied.
	  
	  Create a new osgProducer version of the original GLUT based
	  version.

	* Reverted the changes to ref_ptr<> for implicit cast to pointer.

2003-03-06 17:11  robert

	* Changed the osgText::Font implementation so it used a facade us
	  abstract away
	  the actual implemention. This has been done so that when a
	  freetype font is
	  created the implementation can unloaded when the freetype plugin
	  is unloaded
	  without breaking the main font.
	  
	  Also add image margin around founds to prevent any image
	  boundaries appearing.

2003-03-06 13:45  robert

	* Reverted the ref_ptr<> implementation to prior implicit cast
	  operator via

2003-03-05 21:05  robert

	* Added osgText::String implementation to better handle decoding of
	  encoded text.

2003-03-04 14:17  robert

	* Added osgProducer project file.

2003-03-04 12:34  robert

	* Updates osghud demo.
	  
	  Compile fixes for VisualStudio6.0 because its a hideous pile of
	  junk and can't
	  compile its way out of a paper bag.

2003-03-03 20:28  robert

	* Fix for warning under Windows.

	  Glyph's as well as Font's so keeping the Font valid even after
	  the Font
	  itself has been desctructed.

2003-03-03 15:36  robert

	* Fixes to osgText for default parameter.

	  associated with
	  trying to support VS6 and the rest of the compiler world.

2003-02-25 12:28  robert

	* Renamed osgProducer::CameraGroup and SceneHandler to
	  OsgCameraGroup and
	  OsgSceneHandler to avoid the namespace bug under VS6.
	  
	  Removed the osgproducer demo (its now been replaced by
	  examples/osgviewer.)

2003-02-25 11:56  robert

	* Added osg::Image::AllocationMode enum and associated set/get
	  methods.
	  osg::Image::setImage has also been modified to require the
	  AllocationMode
	  mode to be passed to it so that it knows how to delete the data
	  once the
	  image goes out of scope.
	  
	  Port the image plugins across to specify the new AllocationMode,

	* Implemented an osg::minimum and osg::maximum template functions
	  to replace

	* Completed first pass at providing commandline option usage via
	  the new
	  osg::ArgumentPareser and osg::ApplicationUsage classes. The
	  osgproducer
	  demo has been implemented using these new mechansims.

2003-02-18 21:10  robert

	* Made the osg::ApplicationUsage forward declared.
	  
	  Added include of ostream to ArgumentParser header.

	  opaque
	  to what types are.

2003-02-12 14:39  robert

	* Merged linkage changes from Duncan Cavens to help the OSG osgtext

	  construction to
	  avoid problems under OSX with construction/deletion of
	  std::cout/cerr.

	  SceneView.

2003-01-23 22:12  robert

	* Changed the template insert(,,) method for a std::copy()

	  condition
	  condition can happen.

2003-01-22 20:48  robert

	  and realistic, if they arn't then decal texture can produce
	  better results..

2003-01-22 12:06  robert

	* Fixed an Optimizer crash where if the top most node of a model
	  was
	  a static transform it would crash when this root was deleted.
	  Have fixed
	  by recognising this node as one not to remove and set it to

2003-01-21 16:40  robert

	* Made the pre rendering texture using glCopySubImage rather than
	  copy to image
	  and then copy to texture, as the later was no longer working due
	  to
	  texture->apply ordering.

2003-01-21 16:02  robert

	* Added gaurds around alpha function value to catch erroneous
	  values before they
	  are passed on to the OSG.

2003-01-21 13:22  robert

	* Made a new osgproducer demo based on the new osgProducer::Viewer

	  by text.

2003-01-20 20:33  robert

	  defines respectively.

2003-01-20 10:41  robert

	* Updates from Pavel.
	  
	  1. Storing color of geometry in ColorArray e.g. its don't work

	  that Joseph
	  Steel obtained from MPI.
	  
	  Removed the unique child check from the flt::PrimRecord and
	  osg::Group, this
	  allows more flexibility when specifing nodes, and is faster..

2003-01-20 09:09  robert

	* From Ruben, updates to the IV/VRML1 loader to handler large
	  datasets.

2003-01-20 08:58  robert

	  normalized
	  coord system.
	  
	  Addition of ReadCameraConfigFile and WriteCameraConfigFile as a
	  tempory
	  measure for implementing local a C++ read/write of the
	  Producer::CameraConfig, this
	  will be removed once these implementations or similar have been
	  moved to Producer.

2003-01-18 10:17  robert

	* Added comment about osgProducer to the NEWS.

2003-01-17 20:05  robert

	* Added KeyboardMouse::allowContinousMouseMotionUpdate(), but
	  commented out right

	  daft VisualStudio warnings.

2003-01-15 20:50  robert

	  in the RenderLeaf
	  apply method. This order is intended to help support of vertex

	  referenced counted
	  class and can be safefly created on the stack. To support
	  referenced counting a
	  seperate subclass now exists, this is RefMatrix which inherits
	  from both Matrix and
	  Object.

	  the code associated with loading textures is done is just one
	  place.

2002-11-20 07:46  robert

	* Fixed the texture apply method which was broken yesterday, the
	  new code wasn't
	  checking for the validity of _image before doing checks on it.
	  This breaks when
	  render to texture is used as there is no image to check
	  against...
	  
	  Added osgshadowtexture demo source. Demos still in development,
	  so don't expect

2002-08-29 03:22  don

	* Fixed 69 occurance of 'Seperate' misspelling (should be
	  'Separate')

2002-08-28 21:40  robert

	* Changed instances of new across to use osgNew to help debugging,
	  and fixed

2002-08-28 14:26  robert

	* Added Neil Salter's osgUtx library into the distribution, have
	  put all the
	  orignal seperate headers and source into
	  include/osg/UnitTestFrameWork
	  and src/osg/UnitTestFramework.cpp respectively. I have done this
	  to
	  keep the include and source directories focused on the scene
	  graph rather
	  than the test framework.
	  
	  Have added a very simple unit test to Vec3.cpp, which are
	  optionally
	  compiled in with the OSG_COMPILE_UNIT_TESTS define, which is only
	  currently defined in debug builds under unix. It should be fine
	  to
	  add it in under Windows project files as well.
	  
	  Finally, a new demo app osgunittests runs the tests and reports
	  success
	  or failure of the tests.

2002-08-27 21:01  robert

	* Commented out the #define TEXTURE_USE_DEPRECATED_API from
	  includ/osg/Texture
	  which forces the use of a typedef Texture2D Texture; in place of
	  the orignal
	  texure implementation.

2002-08-27 20:54  robert

	* Added code to write byte/int/float arrays out with 8 values per
	  line by default, rather than
	  1 per line as before.

2002-08-27 20:18  robert

	* Added support for DOFTransforms into .osg format, and add pivot
	  point support
	  to the PositionAttitudeTransform .osg support.
	  
	  Removed a double light reference in the osglight demo.

	* Fixed bug in the Light reading code.

2002-08-27 14:02  robert

	  dynamically
	  contour the scene.

2002-08-27 14:00  robert

	* From Marco, fix to include/GL to clean up warnigns in Windows
	  builds.

2002-08-27 10:06  robert

	* Added osgtexture3D demo, renamed osgtexture demo to osgtexture2D,
	  and have
	  added osgtexture1D demo which currently is simply copy of
	  osgtexture2D. I
	  will be modifying it to do 1D texturing next.
	  
	  Fixed a bug in osg::Texture3D relating to checking of existance
	  of
	  texturing.
	  
	  Merged some fixes to the pfb loader from Ulrich Hertlein.

2002-08-26 20:11  robert

	* Fixed typo of _texParametersDirty.

2002-08-26 19:35  robert

	* Removed #ifdef hacks to remove optimization with VS6.0's STL.
	  VS6.0 STL is
	  now no longer supported!

2002-08-26 15:02  robert

	* Moved the #define GL_DOT3_RGB_ARB's into their own #ifndef
	  GL_ARB_texture_env_dot3 block.

2002-08-26 13:04  robert

	* Moved #define's for OpenGL1.2 image formats into the
	  include/osg/Image header
	  to allow compilation of the rgb plugin under Windows with its 1.1
	  OGL headers.
	  
	  Added float.h to Math's compile path for VS7 compilation.

2002-08-26 12:34  robert

	* Made the sort callback's sort method pure virtual.

2002-08-26 10:24  robert

	* Updated Texture3D to use extension checking to get the relevant
	  3d texturing
	  extensions.

2002-08-26 03:15  don

	* Added writer to RGB plugin

2002-08-25 15:31  robert

	* Converted code dependant on osg::Texture across to its
	  replacement osg::Texture2D.

2002-08-25 11:00  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build

2002-08-24 21:12  robert

	  from osg::TextureBase.

2002-08-24 19:35  robert

	* Clean up of include/osg/GL and include/osg/GLExtensions for
	  better support of

2002-08-22 17:36  don

	* Fixed a dependency order

2002-08-22 09:19  robert

	* Added calling of the LightSource and ClipNode as Group by the
	  NodeVisitor and
	  fixed the CullVisitor and Optimizer to take account of this.

2002-08-22 08:14  robert

	* Fixed the osg::Transform::coompute*() methods so the were using
	  the _referenceFrame
	  correctly, as previously they were doing the exact opposite from
	  what they
	  should have been doing.

2002-08-21 20:42  robert

	* From Stephan Huber, "I found a small bug in QTtexture.c: the code
	  fails, when the image-files
	  don't reside on the boot-partition. I replaced the offending
	  function by a
	  cleaner one.".

2002-08-20 22:43  robert

	* Moved the include<osg/GLExtensions> from the State header into
	  State.cpp, and
	  added it into other files which now required it.

2002-08-20 18:00  robert

	* Added IO Support for TexEnvCombine state attribute.

2002-08-20 14:15  robert

2002-08-20 12:29  robert

	* Added the definition of GL_FOG_COORDINATE_SOURCE to Fog.cpp.
	  
	  Added #include<string> to the GLExtensions header.

2002-08-20 11:27  robert

	* Moved the IO support for the osgText and osgParticle libraries
	  into seperate
	  plugin libraries.

2002-08-20 10:26  robert

	* Added a error message for when OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL is not set
	  correctly.

2002-08-20 10:14  robert

	* Merged fixes to the osg::GLExtensions function pointer code from
	  Stefan Huber,
	  and a fix to osg::State's secondary color code from Bob Kuehne.
	  
	  Moved the body of the getGLExtensionFuncPtr() into the header to
	  help out
	  support for Windows mapping of different OpenGL extensions
	  function ptr per
	  dll.

2002-08-20 10:08  robert

	* A FogCoordinateSource set/get methods to osg::Fog which
	  correspond to the
	  FogCoord support added to osg::Geometry. Added suppot for these
	  new parameters
	  to the .osg plugin.

2002-08-20 08:14  robert

	* Reordered the string comparions so that DEBUG_INFO comes before
	  INFO, since
	  the find op will find INFO in a DEBUG_INFO string, and hence
	  report the wrong
	  notify level.

2002-08-19 19:53  robert

	* Added default values to the TexEnvCombine constructor.

2002-08-19 15:14  robert

	* Added missing include/osg/ClearNode

2002-08-19 15:11  robert

	* Added new osg::TexEnvCombine state attribute.

2002-08-19 11:42  robert

	* Renamed the osg::EarthSky to osg::ClearNode to make it more
	  obvious what
	  role it has play and make it more relevant to non vis-sim
	  applications.

2002-08-19 08:35  robert

	* Moved "unsigned int i" from for(.. to just before it, and removed
	  subsequent
	  ones to get the VisualStudio compiler working once more.

2002-08-18 14:42  robert

	* Added DOFTransform, MatrixTransform and PositionAttitudeTransform
	  to NodeVisitor.
	  
	  Added
	  osg::Matrix/Quat::makeRotate(angle1,axis1,angle2,axis2,angle3,axis3)
	  and
	  osg::Matrix::rotate(angle1,axis1,angle2,axis2,angle3,axis3)
	  method.
	  
	  Made osg::Matrix/Quat::makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) and
	  osg::Matrix::rotate(heading,pitch,roll) all deprecated API.
	  
	  Fixed the Quat*Quat & Quat*=Quat multiplication methods so that
	  they multiplied
	  in the correct order - they were reversed originally due to the
	  Quat code being
	  based on code example which used the v' = M v ordering, rather
	  than the OSG's
	  v' = v M ordering.

2002-08-18 11:16  robert

	* Added check to disable color binding when the secondary colour
	  extension doesn't
	  exist.

2002-08-17 07:34  robert

	* Fixed typo in #define of UBYTE4

2002-08-16 15:14  robert

	* Added Texuture::SubloadCallback example into the osgprerender
	  demo to illustrate
	  how to use it.
	  
	  Changed the ImpostorSprite to use LINEAR,LINEAR for min and mag
	  filters for the
	  impostor texture.

2002-08-16 13:33  robert

	* Added new osg::Texture::SubloadCallback, and getNumMipmapLevels()
	  to osg::Texture
	  and osg::Image. This additions are design to make texture
	  subloading more
	  flexible.

2002-08-16 10:56  robert

	* Fixes from Ulrich Hertlein to get the pfb plugin compiling with
	  using
	  any deprecated API.

2002-08-15 20:27  robert

	* Supported added for secondary color & fog coords to osg::Geometry
	  and osg::State.

2002-08-15 20:25  robert

	* From Perry, support for color added to the
	  MeshPrimtive/LocalVertexPool code.

2002-08-15 15:04  robert

	* Removed the getData() from MeshRecord and the dummy SMesh record,
	  this
	  allow the FaceRecord base class to directly provide the datatype.

2002-08-15 14:09  robert

	* Added a using namespace std; and removed std:: from from std::hex
	  and std::dec.

2002-08-15 13:04  robert

	* Added a virtual keyword into the getData() overrided methods.

2002-08-15 11:25  robert

	* Submission from Perry Miller for support of OpenFlight15.7's
	  local vertex pool
	  and mesh primitives. Converted Perry's code to work with the
	  osg::Geometry
	  instead of osg::GeoSet.

2002-08-14 20:56  robert

	* Added SG_EXPORT to PositionAttitudeTransform and MatrixTransform.

2002-08-14 09:30  robert

	* Commented out the #define USE_DEPRECATED_API.

2002-08-13 18:29  don

	* Added some comments

2002-08-13 15:31  robert

	* Futher improvements and fixes to osg::AnimationPath, and the
	  osglight
	  demo to show it action.

2002-08-13 13:22  robert

	* Made improvements to osg::AnimationPath, added
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform::AnimationPathCallback which us an
	  app callback
	  which uses an AnimationPath to specify the new positions of the
	  transform.
	  
	  Added AnimationPath code to osglight to animate the positional
	  light.
	  
	  Added CullVisitor::setCullingMode() code into SceneView so that
	  SceneView's
	  CullingMode is now properly passed onto CullVisitor. Note, this
	  work
	  had been done before, but must has been lost in a merge. Umm...

2002-08-13 09:35  robert

	* Fixed uninitialized _sortMode.

2002-08-12 17:40  robert

	* Added new s/getPivotPoint() support to
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform.
	  
	  Modified the osglight demo to use an AppCallback and a
	  PositionAttitudeTransform
	  to animate the loaded model.

2002-08-12 13:42  robert

	* Updates to DOFTransform so that its overrides the traverse() and
	  compute*() methods
	  rather than depending upon callbacks for animating and compute
	  matrices. Merged the
	  put/inverseput code between Sasa's and Ferndinand's DOF code.
	  
	  From Bora Utka, Added support to osg::Sequence/OpenFlight
	  AnimNode to the flt plugin.

2002-08-12 13:37  robert

	* attempt to fix read only status of Sequence.cpp.

2002-08-11 21:26  robert

	* Removed dependency of the new osg::DOFTransform and osg::Sequence
	  Node's
	  on osgUtil by implementing a NodeVisitor::VisitorType enum, and
	  associated
	  g/setVisitorType. This allows callbacks to querry the
	  visitor/traversal
	  type without doing down cast's to specific visitor subclasses
	  such as
	  osgUtil::AppVisitor/CullVisitor.

2002-08-11 10:32  robert

	* Temporarily commented out the flat staic transforms visitor since
	  it
	  was causing problems with the new DOFTransform class.

2002-08-09 19:51  robert

	* Submission for Gideon May, fixes for spacing in various osgText
	  files.

2002-08-09 16:27  robert

	* Fixed the X and Y axis rotation billboards so that now rotate
	  correctly.
	  
	  Rewrote the osgbillboard demo so that it creates a point
	  rotatated billbaord
	  and X,Y and Z axis billboards to both test and demonstrate this
	  types of
	  billboards in action.

2002-08-08 21:36  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX 32bit timmer on O2. From Tom Jolley.

2002-08-08 15:10  robert

	* Fixed warning related to where _increasingFlags is an unsigned
	  short and 0xffffff is being
	  truncated, spotted by Tom Jolly.

2002-08-08 15:09  robert

	* Removed inline definition from front of setMaxAnisotropy method.

2002-08-08 13:45  robert

	* Fixed typos, sent in by Warren Macchi.

2002-08-08 13:41  robert

	* Fixed bug related to switching on/off culling modes. Patch from
	  Nikolaus Hanekamp.

2002-08-08 11:27  robert

	* Changed the Geometry::setVertexArray and GeoSet::setCoords so
	  that they
	  call dirtyBound() instead of reseting the local bound flag, this
	  ensures
	  the updates are propagated upwards through into the parents.

2002-08-08 11:01  robert

	* Fixed the shininess factor in 3ds plugin.

2002-08-07 15:52  robert

	* Changed the support for anisotropic filtering in osg::Texture so
	  that it
	  is now controlled via the setMaxAnisotropy(float) method, and is
	  set up
	  independently for the mag filter mode, which it previously was
	  done.

2002-08-07 10:10  robert

	* Renamed osgsequence.cpp to osgsequence.dsp, as it was clearly a
	  typo...

2002-08-07 10:08  robert

	* Fixed type of DOFTransform.cpp

2002-08-06 17:07  robert

	* Added shells for DOFTransform and PositionAttitudeTransform to
	  the .osg
	  loader, still need to fill in the saving and loading of
	  paramters.
	  
	  Went through the distribution remove old API usage.

2002-08-06 10:37  robert

	* Changed the default value of _animationOn to true.

2002-08-06 10:07  robert

	* Fixed typo in comment.

2002-08-06 10:04  robert

	* Adde getViewFrustum() to camera.

2002-08-05 15:07  robert

	* Added new osg::DOFTransform node from Sasa Bistrovic, designed to
	  mirror
	  the OpenFlight DOF transform nodes.

2002-08-05 13:29  robert

	* Added support for PROTECTED modes into the .osg reading and
	  writing.

2002-08-05 13:12  robert

	* Added an example of the use of the PROTECTED modes and attributes
	  into
	  the osgreflect demo so that toggling texturing on or off won't
	  affect
	  the mirror planes texturing.

2002-08-05 12:52  robert

	* Fixed compile errors under IRIX.

2002-08-05 12:40  robert

	* Added support to StateAttribute/State to support PROTECTED flag
	  for modes and attributes
	  so that they cannot be overriden from above via the OVERRIDE
	  flag. This is
	  useful for things like manipulators that have handles display in
	  the scene, you
	  might want to prevent their state being affected by other
	  overriding of
	  light, wireframe modes etc.

2002-08-04 21:11  robert

	* Fix to iv/vrml loader so that it correctly passes back the right
	  ReadResult
	  and checks the validity of the file extension being passed to the
	  plugin.
	  Removed main.cpp * .h moving all its functionality into
	  readerwriter.cpp.

2002-08-04 20:51  robert

	* Changed the error reporting so that it directs it all via
	  osg::notify, and
	  only uses the INFO level for reporting that the file to load is
	  not
	  recognised. Also add check for LWO2 loading so that it returns
	  FILE_NOT_HANDLED
	  message correctly.

2002-08-04 20:34  robert

	* From Ruben Lopez, updates to VRML/IV loader.
	  
	  From Ben Discoe, corrections to comments in osg::Transform
	  
	  From Alberto Barbati, Lazy evaluation of inverse matrix in
	  osg::MatrixTransfrom

2002-08-03 19:42  robert

	* Added Sequence.cpp to osg plugin workspace file.

2002-08-03 19:37  robert

	* Changed the copy constructor of for _light mem var to use a
	  dynamic_cast<StateAttribute*>.

2002-08-03 18:11  robert

	* Integrated Ulrich Hertlien's osg::Sequence node, and osgsequence
	  demo, and
	  support for osg::Sequence in the pfb loader.

2002-08-03 18:03  robert

	* Changed the range max and min members variables to maximum and
	  minimum to
	  prevent collision with windows min and max macros.

2002-08-03 16:49  robert

	* Added support for a sort callback in RenderBin.

2002-08-03 16:48  robert

	* Fixed comments.

2002-08-03 16:37  robert

	* Added cout's of the view frustum to the aid debugging, these
	  cout's are
	  now commented out, and are just left in so that they may be used
	  to
	  double check things in future.

2002-08-02 19:11  robert

	* Fix for Win32 build

2002-08-02 15:14  robert

	* Added missing _nodePath.clear() and _segHitList.clear() to
	  InteresectVisitor::reset().

2002-07-31 15:16  robert

	* Updates to iv/vrml loader from Ruben.

2002-07-30 10:08  robert

	* Updates to the iv loader from Ruben - conversion from GeoSet to
	  Geoemetry.

2002-07-29 21:29  robert

	* Forced the use of non mip mapped texture during subloading in the
	  osgprerender
	  demo.

2002-07-29 00:04  robert

	* Fixes to the new texture subloading methods.

2002-07-28 23:28  robert

	* Checked in new methods for setting up texture subloading, these
	  allow the
	  user to control which parts on an image are subloaded from, and
	  how big
	  the initial texture is.

2002-07-28 23:27  robert

	* Checked in Pavel's updates for non texured surfaces.

2002-07-28 21:25  robert

	* Added set/getUnrefImageOnApply() methods and associated flag and
	  code in Texture::apply() to set the _image to 0 on apply. Note,
	  this will only work when you have a single graphics context, as
	  with multiple graphics contexts one can't delete the image after
	  the first apply, as there will be more than one texture object to
	  update.

2002-07-28 21:15  robert

	* Checked in Marco's commented out #defines/rejigged struct names
	  to get things
	  compiling under Windows, will need to check this in future as it
	  may change with regeneration of parser files
	  with lex/yacc.

2002-07-28 12:52  robert

	* Chagned the initiliazation of iterators, sent in by Alberto

	  from IntersectVisitor.
	  
	  Added deep copy construction of Geometry objects.

2002-07-25 21:45  robert

	* Changed > operator to < and swapped sides of expression, to
	  enable compilation
	  across compilers.

2002-07-25 16:15  robert

	* Fix to geometry combiner which wasn't check the overall color
	  array values
	  in the lessGeometry functor.

2002-07-25 15:25  robert

	* Fix to DOF Record from Sasa Bistroviae.

2002-07-25 15:21  robert

	* Fix for colors in old flt models from Brede.

2002-07-25 14:42  robert

	* Removed double quotes from around the :
	  DBGF = -g -DOSG_USE_MEMORY_MANAGER
	  
	  As this was breaking the build.

2002-07-24 16:29  robert

	* Implemented the DOF handling more cleanly, as per OpenFlight15.7
	  docs.

2002-07-23 18:44  robert

	* Added missing std:: to endl;

2002-07-23 15:48  robert

	* Added the missing _primtives from the copy constructor list.

2002-07-23 15:45  robert

	* Added fog toggling to Viewer.cpp, 'y' reduces fog density, 'Y'
	  increases
	  fog density.

2002-07-23 15:01  robert

	* Mods for HP-UX port.

2002-07-23 14:35  robert

	* Added mode checking into StateSet to try and catch non texture
	  OpenGL modes
	  which have been applied to the texture modes and visa-versa.

2002-07-23 13:30  robert

	* Support added for Gnu C++ under Solaris.

2002-07-23 10:48  robert

	* Checked in Tino Schwarze's port to HP-UX.

2002-07-22 16:01  robert

	* Updates to osgParticle form Macro.

2002-07-22 13:05  robert

	* Merged changed to osgParticle from Macro, these add the ability
	  to
	  orientate the particles to predefined axis.

2002-07-22 12:41  robert

	* Fixed more uninitialized variables and two potential memory
	  leaks.

2002-07-21 20:34  robert

	* Fixed various uninitiliazed variables.

2002-07-21 10:44  robert

	* Added default construction values for various member variables to
	  fix report
	  uninitialized variables.

2002-07-21 10:04  robert

	* Futher work on ensuring that all datatypes are initilizaed in OSG
	  objects.

2002-07-21 01:29  robert

	* Futher changes to remove unitialized variables/reordering of
	  initialization to
	  prevent unitialized warnings.

2002-07-20 23:54  robert

	* Various fixes to constructors to ensure that all variables are
	  initialized.

2002-07-20 22:44  robert

	* Added missing default values to State constructor.

2002-07-20 22:40  robert

	* Added default values for FrameStamp.cpp constructor.

2002-07-20 22:36  robert

	* Removed the rendundent variables in the ConvexPlanerPolygon as
	  these were
	  unused and unitialized.

2002-07-20 22:36  robert

	* Added new debugging switch checkOnAllocations which is now on by
	  default
	  when compiling with debug build (under UNIX) and can be turned on
	  or off
	  with the OSG_MM_CHECK_ON_ALLOCATIONS environmental variable.

2002-07-20 21:37  robert

	* Added some extra checks for memory initialization into the
	  osg::MemoryManager,
	  this is turned off by default, even in debug build. However you
	  can turn it
	  on by setting the OSG_MM_CHECK_FOR_UNINITIALIZED

2002-07-20 18:27  robert

	* Umm... these should have already been commited, not sure why cvs
	  has just
	  popped these ones up...

2002-07-20 16:24  don

2002-07-19 14:52  robert

	* Updated Doyxgen files.

2002-07-19 14:19  robert

	* Updates to the Geometry to add more access methods, and updates
	  to Optimizer
	  to add the new merge primtives option.

2002-07-19 13:49  robert

	* Added primitve merging into the osg::Geometry optimizer.

2002-07-19 12:51  robert

	* Removed the cow.osg paramter for the osgparticle cow.osg in the
	  test scripts

2002-07-19 10:18  robert

	* Added MatrixTransform.cpp.

2002-07-19 09:10  robert

	* Changed the "reflect.rgb" path to "Images/reflect.rgb" to the
	  help find the
	  file required.

2002-07-18 22:35  robert

	* Updates NEWS file for 0.9.0 release.
	  
	  Added default computeBound() implementation to osg::Drawable
	  which uses
	  a PrimtiveFunctor to compute the bounding box in a generic way,
	  that
	  will work for all Drawable subclasses that implement the
	  accept(PrimitiveFunctor&).

2002-07-18 22:34  robert

	* Added osgoccluder to test scripts.

2002-07-18 19:54  robert

	* Moved the 't' operation on texture modes across to use the new
	  StateSet::setTextureMode methods, this enables 't' to work once
	  more!

2002-07-18 19:54  robert

	* Updated docs ready for the release.

2002-07-18 19:41  robert

	* Moved get/setUserData from osg::Node into its superclass
	  osg::Object to
	  allow other subclasses to add their own custom data.

2002-07-18 15:36  robert

	* Rewrote the osg::Drawable::AttributeFunctor and PrimtiveFunctor
	  to make
	  them more consistent with each other. This does mean an API
	  change, so
	  dependanct code in the OSG has been updated accordingly.

2002-07-18 15:28  robert

	* From Randall Hopper, warning fixes for IRIX.

2002-07-18 15:25  robert

	* From Brede Johansen, fix the TexturePaletteRecord::endian() to
	  handle
	  old flt versions (11, 12 & 13).

2002-07-18 14:29  robert

	* From Brede Johansen
	  "I have found one bug in the ConvertFromFLT::visitFace()
	  function. In the
	  early days of the Flight format, before the LightPoint record
	  existed
	  they used face records with a light (-point) attribute."

2002-07-18 14:20  robert

	* Rewrote osg:Statistics so that it is PrimitiveFunctor as is now
	  completely
	  decoupled from osg::Drawable. The Drawable::getStats() virtual
	  method
	  no longer exists.
	  
	  Updated the Viewer to use the osg::Statistics incarnation and
	  reformated stats
	  to clean it up.

2002-07-18 10:55  robert

	* Added code into osg::LightSource so it correctly computes its
	  bounding
	  sphere, taking into account any subgraph below, and the light
	  itself
	  if it is not a infinite light.

2002-07-18 10:49  robert

	* Updated the test scripts to include cube mapping example and
	  osglight demo.

2002-07-18 10:41  robert

	* Removed repeated return transform in the visitDOF method.

2002-07-18 10:38  robert

	* Added support for .sgi alias extension to the .rgb plugin.

2002-07-18 10:06  robert

	* Fixed warnings.

2002-07-18 09:55  robert

	* Converted the osg::Material::set/getShininess option to use the
	  standard
	  OpenGL range of 0.0 to 128.0 instead of the previous normalised
	  shiniess
	  range. This brings it inline with the way the rest of the OSG
	  uses a
	  1 to 1 mapping to OpenGL.
	  
	  Converted the various loaders to use the new range, which is
	  almost all
	  cases was simply removing the /128.0f which was required before!

2002-07-18 09:17  robert

	* Added const to LessGeometry functor to fix Win32 build.

2002-07-18 00:55  robert

	* Fixed spelling mistake.

2002-07-18 00:53  robert

	* Various fixes to the flt loader, and knock on changes to the
	  osgUtil::Optimizer
	  to better support removal of seperate osg::Geometry instances
	  where they
	  share the same state and bindings.

2002-07-17 16:24  robert

	* Changed from a -> to *() when using the object pointed to by a
	  reverse iterator,
	  to fix problems with build under VS6/STLport.

2002-07-17 12:21  robert

	* Fix for Win32 build.

2002-07-17 10:00  robert

	* Several items of work related to adding a manual creation of
	  occluders
	  option to the osgoccluder demo.
	  
	  First the osgGA classes have been generalised a little to better
	  support
	  new GUIEventHandler subclasses.
	  
	  Second osgGLUT has a new option for registering a user defined
	  event handler,
	  the allows the application to add externally extra options to the
	  osgGLUT viewer.
	  
	  Third, the osgoccluder demo now works in two modes. The original
	  create
	  four occluder sides to wrap an loaded model, the second an
	  interactive
	  mode which allows the users to add occluders to the model by
	  pointing
	  to points and pressing 'a' to add a point, the 'e' to end the
	  occluder
	  polygon, polygons must be convex, planer and be defined in an
	  anitclockwise
	  order. To start the osgoccluder in this mode one simple runs it
	  with the
	  '-c' option. Run osgoccluder with no parameter to get a list of
	  options.

2002-07-16 20:07  robert

	* Updated docs and added osgGA

2002-07-16 19:21  robert

	* Updates from Bob Kuehne and Kristopher Bixler to remove the fink
	  dependency from the MacOSX build.

2002-07-16 19:19  robert

	* Fix to DOF Record from Sasa Bistrovic

2002-07-16 19:17  robert

	* Added SpotExponent to the spot light.

2002-07-16 18:56  robert

	* Removed repeat line from Makefile.

2002-07-16 15:43  robert

	* Bumped up the version numbers to 0.9.0 to reflect the upcomming
	  release.

2002-07-16 15:28  robert

	* Rewrote the apply_imp template method so that it takes an
	  initialization
	  paramater.

2002-07-16 15:13  robert

	* Fixes for MacOSX build from Bob Kuehne.

2002-07-16 15:12  robert

	* Added the beginings of an osglight demo.

2002-07-16 11:33  robert

	* Added TextureCubeMap.cpp to the .osg plugin Makefile.

2002-07-16 10:20  robert

	* Fixed the new TemplateArray desctructor.

2002-07-16 10:16  robert

	* Added protected destrcutor to TemplateArray.

2002-07-15 22:23  robert

	* Added support to osgUtil::Tesselator to insert extra vertices and
	  other
	  attributes into an osg::Geometry node. Uses the new
	  osg::ArrayVisitor.
	  
	  Converted the osg plugin Geometry support to use the new UByte4
	  class.

2002-07-15 22:18  robert

	* Added osg::UByte4 class, which can be used to represent packed
	  colors.
	  
	  Changed osg::UByte4Array across to use the new osg::UByte4 class
	  rather
	  than a GLuint as do previously.
	  
	  Cleaned up some of the paramters in osg::Vec4.

2002-07-15 13:39  robert

	* Removed the second texture from the prerender demo so as not over
	  complicate
	  the final image.

2002-07-15 13:20  robert

	* Fixed the orientation of the osgreflect demo so that the
	  reflection plane
	  is orientated towards the viewer.
	  
	  Changed the lightmodel ambient level to 0.1,0.1,0.1 instead of
	  0.0, so that
	  a small amount of ambient lighting is available to render back
	  surfaces.
	  The osgreflect and osgprerender suffered unexpected behaviors
	  because of
	  no lighting on the backfaces.

2002-07-15 13:14  robert

	* Added a MatrixTransform to tilt the osgreflect demo so that the
	  reflection
	  plane is seen clearly.

2002-07-15 13:13  robert

	* Fixed the optimization of the orientation conversion.

2002-07-15 11:44  robert

	* Fixed memory leak in FieldReaderIterator.cpp.
	  
	  Updated the Make/osgtests.bat and Make/debugtests.bat scripts.

2002-07-15 10:53  robert

	* Renamed hangglide to osghangglide

2002-07-15 10:51  robert

	* Removed the old hangglide directory.

2002-07-15 10:45  robert

	* Renamed osghangglide demo.

2002-07-15 10:43  robert

	* Renamed the hangglide demo osghangglide to make it consistent
	  with the rest
	  of the demos.

2002-07-15 10:03  robert

	* Added State::disableTexCoordPointersAboveAndIncluding( unit )
	  method so that
	  all unsed texture units can be turned off simply within Drawables
	  such
	  as Geometry and GeoSet. This can be used to prevent bleed of
	  arrays from
	  one object to the next - which can cause crashes.

2002-07-15 04:42  don

	* Changes for Sunos

2002-07-14 21:49  don

	* Added Logos loader

2002-07-14 20:51  robert

	* Fixed unused variable `osg::StateSet *osgStateSet' warning

2002-07-14 20:48  robert

	* Added Drawable::AppCallback example and fixed a warning.

2002-07-14 20:32  robert

	* Tweaked the color and aspect ratio settings of the pre rendering
	  bin.

2002-07-14 16:26  robert

	* Fixed computeNearFar bug in CullVisitor::apply(Billboard&).

2002-07-14 10:46  robert

	* Fixes to read/write of MatrixTransform/Transform.

2002-07-14 08:35  robert

	* Copy and Paste bug where an for() loop was repeated within
	  itself, which
	  was introduced when moving across to use osg::Geometry.

2002-07-13 21:17  robert

	* Fixed various warnings which were appearing under MacOSX.

2002-07-13 20:31  robert

	* Conveted GeoSet to use the new state::set*Pointer/disable*Pointer
	  methods
	  to keep the current state valid.

2002-07-13 14:16  robert

	* Support added for multitextured TXP files, sent in by Boris
	  Bralo.

2002-07-13 02:46  don

	* put a typedef in public area of class for sun compilers

2002-07-12 21:45  robert

	* Added missing MatrixTransform.cpp file

2002-07-12 21:45  robert

	* added glutInit to osgparticle demo to fix crash under MacOSX.

2002-07-12 21:42  robert

	* Added second texture to osgprerender demo to test out
	  multitexture in
	  osg::Geometry, it works!!

2002-07-12 21:08  robert

	* Added MatrixTransform header and source.

2002-07-12 19:50  robert

	* Changed the osgmultitexture demo so that it uses a TexEnv::BLEND
	  mode
	  with a colour. This lightens the resultant models.

2002-07-12 18:14  robert

	* Added using namespace osgUtil to get round IRIX/Windows compiler
	  differences.

2002-07-12 18:12  robert

	* Ported distribution across to use the new osg::MatrixTransform
	  and osg::BlendFunc
	  class instead of osg::Transform and osg::Transparancy
	  respectively.

2002-07-12 14:25  robert

	* Have added a #define USE_DEPRECATED_API to include/osg/Export,
	  and
	  various
	  osg header and source files to optional compile in deprecated
	  parts of
	  the
	  OSG API.
	  
	  Have renamed osg::Transparency osg::BlendFunc to bring it in line
	  with
	  the
	  rest of the OSG's StateAttribute classes which are named after
	  their
	  OpenGL counterparts. include/osg/Transparency still exists and is
	  simply
	  a typedef to BlendFunc and is enclosed in a #ifdef
	  USE_DEPRECTATED_API
	  block.
	  
	  The matrix methods in the osg::Transform class have been
	  moved/replicated in
	  a osg::MatrixTransform sublcass from osg::Transform. The old
	  matrix
	  functionality is still present in the osg::Transform class but is
	  guard
	  by #ifdef USG_DEPRECATED_API blocks. One should now think of
	  osg::Transform
	  as being a Transform Node base class. MatrixTransform has all the
	  functionality of the original Transform class, so should be used
	  instead.

2002-07-12 13:00  robert

	* Fix, sent in by Macro Jez, to the set of the camera with the
	  computed near and far plane, so that
	  it is only updated when _computeNearFar !=
	  CullVisitor::DO_NOT_COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR.

2002-07-12 10:30  robert

	* Added blend color to osg::TexEnv

2002-07-12 09:16  robert

	* Fixed indenting.

2002-07-12 08:48  robert

	* Addition of RoadRecords from Yefei He.

2002-07-11 23:30  don

	* added -lpthread to the link line for Linux builds. Seems Red Hat
	  7.3
	  turns up undefined symbols without it.

2002-07-11 21:08  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build

2002-07-11 18:33  robert

	* Added Makefile for osgmultitexture demos.

2002-07-11 18:32  robert

	* Added #define for GL_TEXTURE0_ARB

2002-07-11 16:12  robert

	* Added support for multitexturing to osg::State and added
	  osgmultitexture
	  demo which adds as spherical environment map using texture 1 to
	  any model.

2002-07-11 14:32  robert

	* Moved the code referencing osg::BoundingBox::isValid() and
	  osg::BoundingSphere::isValid() across to use the valid() methods,
	  the later
	  being more consitent with other classes such as osg::ref_ptr<>.

2002-07-11 12:57  robert

	* Fixes for win32 build

2002-07-11 11:36  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build

2002-07-11 11:33  robert

	* Fixed bug in disabledTexCoordPointer where a '>' was being used
	  where it
	  should have been a '>='.

2002-07-11 11:08  robert

	* Fixed the pathname for the osgprerender demo.

2002-07-11 08:28  robert

	* changed unsigned int/short/char* references to
	  GLuint,GLushort,GLubyte respectively.

2002-07-10 22:38  robert

	* Updates for new use of GLushort instead of osg::ushort in GeoSet
	  index pointer.

2002-07-10 22:33  robert

	* Tidied up the types in osg::GeoSet so that the index pointers use
	  GLushort
	  and GLuint to get round compile issues under MacOSX.

2002-07-10 20:30  robert

	* Updates to osg::Drawable::AppCallback and osgprerender demo.

2002-07-10 15:35  robert

	* Added app callback to Drawable.

2002-07-10 13:33  robert

	* Updates to osgprerender to support use of rendering to an image,
	  rather then
	  just a texture.

2002-07-10 11:26  robert

	* Rejigged the line endings.

2002-07-10 11:22  robert

	* Ported all the demos and loaders across to use the new
	  multitexturing API.

2002-07-10 09:32  robert

	* Added Yefei He's RoadRecords to the flt loader, these records
	  will be
	  ignored by the loader, but will allow the loader to skip over
	  them and
	  continue reading the rest of the file correctly.

2002-07-10 09:14  robert

	* Updates from Macro to support the new multitexture API, and
	  improve
	  bounding box computation.

2002-07-10 09:04  robert

	* Added setCurrentRenderBin() method.

2002-07-09 19:23  robert

	* Implemented more code for the new osgprerender demo.

2002-07-09 13:31  robert

	* Updates to the osgprerender code. Still doesn't do anything
	  interesting yet..

2002-07-09 13:17  robert

	* Added new demo osgprerender to demonstrate how to prerender a
	  scene and use
	  the result in the main rendering for special effects.

2002-07-09 10:33  robert

	* Warnings fixes for IRIX - there was a missing "const" in the
	  sameKindAs(.) method.

2002-07-09 10:23  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build.

2002-07-09 09:35  robert

	* Implemented most of the changes required for supporting
	  multitexturing in
	  the osg::State/osg::StateSet/osg::StateAttribute and related
	  classes.

2002-07-08 09:42  robert

	* Added Mike Connell to authors list.

2002-07-07 22:12  robert

	* Added comment to reflect Clay Fowlers findings on getting VS to
	  compile
	  without the Vector wrapper classes.

2002-07-07 22:08  robert

	* Added winsock32 libs to osgcluster demo.

2002-07-07 20:16  robert

	* Rehashed the osgcluster project file to see if it solves the
	  failure under
	  windows.

2002-07-07 17:42  robert

	* Fixes for Windows build.

2002-07-07 17:40  robert

	* Added include<unistd.h> to __DARWIN_OSX__ build.

2002-07-07 17:30  robert

	* Did a to_dos on osgcluster.dsp since it was original saved with
	  unix file endings.

2002-07-07 14:40  robert

	* Work on supporting multitexturing in
	  State/StateSet/StateAttribute/Geoemtry.

2002-07-04 18:47  robert

	* Added VisualStudio files for Win32 port of osgcluster demo.

2002-07-04 18:41  robert

	* Added support for Win32 broadcast and recience over lan. Changes
	  sent in
	  by Michael Gronager.

2002-07-04 14:49  robert

	* Used typedef's for std::vector<>'s used inside DrawElements
	  implementations.
	  
	  Added deperecated comment to osg::GeoSet header.

2002-07-04 14:23  robert

	* Added osgGA to the MIGNW makedefs.

2002-07-04 09:49  robert

	* Fixed the TriangleFunctor QUAD_STRIP code so that it produces
	  consistent
	  results.

2002-07-03 20:33  robert

	* Spotted by Neil Salter - missing transform. in the Transform copy
	  operator.

2002-07-03 11:16  robert

	* Added osgUtil dependency to the flt project.

2002-07-02 19:53  robert

	* Reimplemted the osgUtil::SceneView::setCalcNearFar()
	  functionality to bring
	  it inline with the CullStack/CullVisitor implementation. Also
	  added the
	  setSmallFeatureCullingPixelSize() method and wired them up inside
	  SceneView.cpp so they set the corresponding CullVisitor
	  paramters.
	  
	  Intergrated pfImage copying change in the Performer plugin,
	  submission sent in by Ulrich Hertlein

2002-07-02 15:01  don

	* -n32 and -64 entries were reversed in makedefs

2002-07-02 06:28  don

	* osgcallback required fixes for new osg::Drawable::CullCallback

2002-07-02 06:22  don

	* Added support for CullVisitor to contain a osg::State. This used
	  when
	  cull Callbacks require the contextID for doing operations on
	  texture
	  objects, for example. Modified CullVisitor SceneView and Drawable

2002-07-01 14:40  don

	* More 64 bit build specifics in IRIX makedefs file

2002-07-01 14:20  don

	* Removed -ldl from makedefs for IRIX

2002-06-28 22:42  robert

	* Rewrote the osgUtil::Tesselator so that it is easier to use, and
	  can also
	  easily retesselate osg::Primitive::POLYGONS found in Geometry
	  objects.
	  Added calls to the tesselate to the lwo and flt loaders.

2002-06-28 20:54  robert

	* A couple fixes to remove Performer runtime warnings.

2002-06-28 16:25  robert

	* Fixes from Ulrich Hertlein to build of pfb plugin. Small mods to
	  these
	  by Robert.

2002-06-28 14:42  robert

	* Added to the osggeometry demo.

2002-06-28 11:11  robert

	* Rewriting the osggeomtry demo to illustrate more primitive types.

2002-06-28 08:47  robert

	* Removed commas from the end of enum lists.

2002-06-28 08:36  robert

	* Change =0 to osg::Vec2Array::iterator() in .obj loader to get
	  round warnings
	  under gcc3.0.x

2002-06-27 20:29  robert

	* Ported the flt plugin across to use osg::Geometry, it still uses
	  a GeoSet
	  internally, and I will remove this after some futher work.

2002-06-27 15:18  robert

	* Added SG_EXPORT which was missing.

2002-06-27 13:15  robert

	* Converted the template DrawElements primitive class into three
	  seperate
	  non templated classes - UByteDrawElements, UShortDrawElements,
	  UIntDrawElements.

2002-06-27 10:50  robert

	* Moved the AttributeArray and Primitive classes into their own
	  header and
	  source files.

2002-06-27 09:56  robert

	* Removed the test aginst a iterator as a bool.

2002-06-26 21:11  robert

	* Added comment to explain #ifdefs for member templates.

2002-06-26 21:10  robert

	* Added #idef to Export to add check for support for member
	  templates.

2002-06-26 21:08  robert

	* Ported LWO loader across to use osg::Geometry. Work not quite
	  complete,
	  as we need to retesselate any concave polygons that can exists in
	  these
	  datasets.

2002-06-26 17:48  robert

	* Added templated constructor to TemplateArray & DrawElements
	  template to
	  handle VisualStudio7.0 build.
	  
	  Ported 3DS across to use osg::Geometry instead of osg::GeoSet.

2002-06-26 14:34  robert

	* Ported pfb, txp and obj loaders across to use osg::Geometry.

2002-06-26 10:28  robert

	* Ported various demos and support classes over to use the new
	  osg::Geometry class
	  thus removing dependancy on osg::Geoset from most of the OSG,
	  only loaders
	  left to port now.

2002-06-25 20:47  robert

	* Fixes for Cygwin build from Norman Vine.

2002-06-25 20:36  robert

	* Fix to Quat::slerp so that it interpolates along the shortest
	  path.

2002-06-25 20:27  robert

	* Added osg::Drawable::PrimitiveFunctor and TriangleFunctor
	  subclass for
	  querrying the primitive data inside Drawables. Moved various
	  support
	  classes over from being osg::GeoSet based to osg::Geometry based.

2002-06-24 21:44  robert

	* Fixed osgText::Text::DrawModeType::ALIGNEMENT spelling mistake,
	  now
	  is ALIGNMENT.

2002-06-24 21:37  robert

	* Checked in .osg support for the new osg::Geometry class.

2002-06-24 12:53  robert

	* Added required std:: to front of endl to fix Win32 build.

2002-06-23 21:43  robert

	* Added conversion to osg::GeoSet::converToGeometry() utility to
	  help the
	  migration to and testing of the new osg::Geometry class.

2002-06-22 15:46  robert

	* Compile Fixes for Win32.

2002-06-21 19:24  robert

	* Temporarily removed the references to multi-texturing calls.

2002-06-21 16:45  robert

	* Added new osggeometry demo to test the work on the new
	  osg::Geometry Drawable.

2002-06-21 15:14  robert

	* Bug fix to the size calculation of bmp images, changed both the
	  reading and
	  writing of images.

2002-06-21 07:48  robert

	* Fixed constructor for TemplateArray(const TemplateArray& t,const
	  CopyOp& copyop).

2002-06-20 19:54  robert

	* Addd new experimental osg::Geometry Drawable which will
	  eventually replace
	  GeoSet. Currently doesn't draw anything, and is very much in the
	  early design stages.

2002-06-20 18:17  robert

	* Mods to MemoryManager to make the optimized build produce dummy
	  implementations for all the public functions found in the header,
	  this should prevent problems when not compiling in the
	  MemoryManager
	  under IRIX 64 build.

2002-06-19 20:38  robert

	* Fixed incorrect naming of ConvexPlanerOccluder.

2002-06-19 18:45  robert

	* Added support for reading the new OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE
	  environmental variable
	  inside the osg::Image::ensureValidSizeForTexturing() method. The
	  smallest of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE and OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE is used
	  for the
	  final max texture size.
	  
	  This new env. var. allows users to deliberate cap the size of
	  their textures
	  so they can test whether their models are limited by texture
	  memory. If
	  reducing the max texture size increases performance then you are
	  limited
	  by texture memory!

2002-06-19 16:06  robert

	* Added support for reading and writing OccluderNode's to the .osg
	  file format.

2002-06-19 15:18  robert

	* Added computation of the bounding volume of osg::OccluderNodes.
	  
	  Added support for
	  osg::BoundingSphere::expandBy*(osg::BoundingBox) and have
	  added osg::BoundingSphere/Box::valid() which deprecates
	  isValid(), this
	  is to be more consistent with other classes in the OSG.

2002-06-19 10:19  robert

	* Added support for occlusion of holes in occluders, and cleaned up
	  the
	  interface to ShadowVolumeOccluders.

2002-06-19 08:34  robert

	* Changed the osg::LightSource so its Light attribute is now
	  generalised to
	  be a StateAttribute. This allows alternative implementations of
	  Lights
	  other than the standard osg::Light.

2002-06-18 22:35  robert

	* Added support for occluders occluding other occluders, which
	  helps reduce
	  the number of occluder that will be used in cull traversal to
	  only the
	  ones that will be effective. Note. Holes in occluders arn't
	  handled in
	  this occluder occlusion test, will implement this later.

2002-06-18 10:18  robert

	* Clean ups for the Windows build.

2002-06-18 09:09  robert

	* Added the length argument to a std::string argument, under Linux
	  it
	  compiled with the default value npos, under Windows it broke the
	  build,
	  add the npost excpilicity should get round this difference in
	  implementation.

2002-06-17 21:50  robert

	* Rewrote the FileUtils support for data and library file paths,
	  moving the
	  storage of the path lists into osgDB::Registry, and changed the
	  data
	  structor from a char* to a std::deque. Changed a names of couple
	  of the
	  convinience functions in osgDB/FileUtils to better reflect the
	  two
	  public FilePathList's - DataFilePathList and the
	  LibraryFilePathList.
	  
	  Added support into the osgDB::Registry::readNode/Image/Object
	  methods
	  for pushing and popping the path of the current file being
	  loaded.

2002-06-17 09:10  robert

	* Fixes to the occluder culling code to properly disable occluders
	  to prevent
	  self occlusion.

2002-06-15 20:57  robert

	* Fixes for Visual .NET and Mingw builds, and fix MacOSX notify()
	  crash.

2002-06-15 12:14  robert

	* Added computation of occluders volume scaled relative to the
	  frustum volume,
	  all volumes computed in eye coords.

2002-06-14 16:28  robert

	* Added computation of the occluders volume, scale it to a ratio of
	  the
	  frustum.

2002-06-14 14:50  robert

	* Added occluder hole test code into the osgoccluder demo. The code
	  works,
	  but I've commented it out right now as the Geode physically
	  representing
	  the occluder doesn't yet have a hole in it - just a cosmetic
	  thing.

2002-06-14 13:49  robert

	* Refined the CollectOccluderVisitor so that it checks the subgraph
	  below
	  a node contains occluders before traversing.

2002-06-14 11:27  robert

	* Improvements to the plane clipping code.

2002-06-14 08:45  robert

	* Further updates to the occlusion culling code, also adding
	  missing OccludeNode
	  file the .osg plugin.

2002-06-13 23:46  robert

	* Further work on occlusion culling.

2002-06-13 19:39  don

	* removed the use of gettimeofday for 32 bit architectures...

2002-06-13 19:34  robert

	* Added #include <osg/ref_ptr> so that it will compile properly
	  regardless
	  of include order.

2002-06-13 19:10  robert

	* Added -osgGA to the Makefile list.

2002-06-13 18:27  robert

	* Merge Randall's changes.

2002-06-13 16:21  robert

	* Further work on Occlusion Culling. Most of work is complete, just
	  debugging
	  required now.

2002-06-12 16:23  robert

	* Removed inappropriate inline keyword which was breaking the IRIX
	  build.

2002-06-12 15:43  robert

	* IRIX build fix.

2002-06-12 14:57  robert

	* Changes for MacOSX build, send in by Bob Kuehne.

2002-06-12 14:46  robert

	* Fixed the osgDB::getFilePath, osgDB::getSimpleFileName() and
	  osgDB::getStrippedName()
	  so that they check for both unix style '/' and windows style '\'
	  slashes in
	  file names.

2002-06-12 13:54  robert

	* Fix for renaming of ShadowOccluderVolume to ShadowVolumeOccluder.

2002-06-12 09:22  robert

	* Further work on occludision code.

2002-06-11 19:52  robert

	* A little more work on Occlusion culling.

2002-06-11 18:41  robert

	* Checked in Macro Jez's additions to osgText to support .osg IO
	  make it
	  a fully functioning NodeKit.
	  
	  Also reimplement notify() to try an prevent a crash which has
	  been caused by
	  to objects in notify.cpp being initiliazed twice, the second time
	  the auto_ptr
	  holding the dev/null ofstream was being initilized to 0.

2002-06-10 13:50  robert

	* Added osg::CollectOccludersVisitor which is a helper class for
	  finding active
	  occluder in the view frustum, to be used as pre cull traversal.

2002-06-10 11:21  robert

	* Created new helper class osg::CullStack to handle the
	  accumulation of projection,
	  modelview and culling sets, to be used during travesal of the
	  scene graph, such
	  as the cull traversal.

2002-06-09 13:10  robert

	* Checked in migration from osgUtil based GUIAdapter code to Neil
	  Salter's
	  osgGA (Gui Abstraction). This may break users code, but all it
	  should
	  require to fix the builds should be a change from
	  osgUtil::CameraManipulator (etc) to osgGA::CameraManipulator and
	  include <osgUtil/CameraManipulator (etc) to
	  osgGA/CameraManipulator and
	  the extra dependency of the link line.

2002-06-08 19:58  robert

	* More more occlusion culling.

2002-06-07 20:03  robert

	* Added osgoccluder demo, it creates a single quad occluder, but
	  the culling
	  code is not complete yet, so it won't actually do any occlusion
	  culling,
	  the demo is here so I can test the evolving occlusion culling
	  code.

2002-06-07 14:54  don

	* #ifdefed out cstdlib for irix

2002-06-07 13:57  robert

	* Added default IntersectVisitor::_hitReportingMode to be
	  ONLY_NEAREST_HIT.

2002-06-07 11:32  robert

	* Fixed a couple of problems with the NodeKit support.

2002-06-07 10:03  robert

	* Added support for NodeKits to the osgDB::Registry. Object names
	  in .osg
	  files which have the library::class syntax will automatically
	  invoke
	  the dynamic loading of either a nodekit or database plugin.

2002-06-06 14:00  robert

	  to replace VisualStudio standard one, this enabled VS to
	  reconginse OSG
	  header files as C++ files.

2002-05-23 15:35  robert

	* Fixed a bug in the Optimizer::RemoveDuplicateNodesVisitor which
	  was prevent
	  removal of node which could have been removed.
	  
	  Added so extra convinience methods to ClippingVolume and utilized
	  them in the
	  CullVisitor to push and pop only culling planes that are active.

2002-05-22 19:58  don

	* Fixed spelling error Calander -> Calendar

2002-05-22 12:19  robert

	* Removed the usage of memory manager from the debug windows build.

2002-05-22 12:01  robert

	* Added osgUtil::CullVisitor::getCurentRenderGraph() and

	  methods which replace getRenderGraph(). Small changing of order
	  of push/pop
	  of StateSet's in SceneView to clean things up.

2002-05-22 10:04  robert

	* Changed the public osg::State::applyMode() and applyAttribute
	  methods so that
	  they dirty the associated state, this helps keep the OpenGL state
	  valid once
	  out of local drawing routines.

2002-05-22 08:50  robert

	* Updates for Doxygen and osgGA headers from Neil.

2002-05-21 19:34  robert

	* Typo and grammer fixes to introduction.html from Neil Salter.

2002-05-21 09:16  robert

	* Renamed osg::State::getCurrentMode/Attribute(..) to
	  getLastAppliedMode/Attribute() to make it more consistent with
	  the internal
	  workings of osg::State.

2002-05-21 08:59  robert

	* Added osg::State::getCurrentMode and
	  osg::State::getCurrentAttribute().
	  
	  Aded osg::clampAbove(..) and osg::clampBelow() template functions
	  to
	  include/osg/Math.

2002-05-21 00:58  don

	* Modified instrules so that the functionality of instlinks is that
	  system links are not made to point to links, rather the real
	  files. So
	  links installed on a system are pointing to platform specific
	  files rather
	  than links that may be pointing to files of the wrong platform
	  type.

2002-05-18 08:39  robert

	* Various API updates to suppor light points developments better,
	  but should also
	  benifit other extensions to rendering.

2002-05-18 08:37  robert

	* Made trilinear filtering the default mode for osg::Texture's.

2002-05-18 08:35  robert

	* Modified the setting of min and mag texture filter modes to
	  produce higher
	  quality mip maps.

2002-05-15 19:58  robert

	* Fixed problem with orhographic projections due to a bug in
	  CullVisitor
	  where it automatically resets the near and far to the values
	  calculated
	  during cull traversal. The maths for converting the computed far
	  and near
	  into clip coordinates was wrong, fixed this and the problem goes
	  away.

2002-05-15 11:27  robert

	* Exposed the CullVisitor::setComputeNearFarMode

2002-05-14 10:20  robert

	* Fix compile problems with osgGA under Windows.

2002-05-09 18:59  robert

	* Added pixelSize method to CullVisitor, and converted small
	  feature
	  culling to use the pixelSize method instead of a ratio of radius
	  to
	  distance from eye point. setSmallFeatureCullingPixelSize() method
	  has also been added to provide the user with finer control of
	  small
	  featyre culling.

2002-05-09 10:31  robert

	* Added new osgGA - GUI Adapter library submitted by Neil Salter.
	  This will
	  replace the current GUI adapter code inside osgUtil.

2002-05-08 07:32  robert

	* Addded missing ClipNode references to osg.dsp.

2002-05-07 11:44  robert

	* Fixed osg::Camera::getModelViewMatrix() so that it handles the
	  EYE_TO_MODEL
	  transform correctly.
	  
	  Fixed warning in ClipNode.cpp.

2002-05-07 11:12  robert

	* Fixed rpath nonsense in makedefs for Irix

2002-05-03 22:47  robert

	* Added osg::Node::getValidStateSet().

2002-05-03 16:47  robert

	* Added support for the managing the StateSet above a LightSource
	  node,
	  and made it an osg::Group so that it can be used a decorator
	  above a
	  scene.
	  
	  Added osgclip demo to the test suite.

2002-05-02 22:02  robert

	* Made osg::Viewport::getViewport(..) const.

2002-05-02 00:14  robert

	* dded osg::ClipNode class for managing OpenGL clipping planes, and
	  osgclip demo.

	* Fix for CisualStudio6.0 build.

2002-04-26 08:25  robert

	* Fixed remaining MAX_PATH usuage, replacing it with the new
	  DX_MAX_PATH, this
	  should solve compile problems under VisualStudio .NET.

2002-04-26 08:16  robert

	* Qarning fixes, and updated the date in NEWS to reflect todays
	  release of 0.8.45

	* Fixes to .obj plugin from gideon.

2002-04-25 11:29  robert

	* Added Bob to the AUTHORS list for his efforts on MacOSX.

2002-04-25 10:46  robert

	* A more verbose version of the test script, using each and more
	  memleaks.log
	  to print out progress and report any memory leaks which have been
	  logged.
	  The later will only occur with a debug build. The use of echo and
	  more
	  makes this version osgtest.bat not portable to windows
	  unfortuntately.

2002-04-25 10:14  robert

	* Added another bullet point to the plan.

2002-04-25 10:10  robert

	* Removed these old files that do little in the context of the
	  current
	  OpenSceneGraph disitribution apart from clogs things up!

2002-04-25 10:07  robert

	* Add doc/plan.html and links to it from the rest of the docs.

2002-04-25 08:54  robert

	* Fixed compile problem under VisualStudio.

2002-04-25 07:47  robert

	  osgviews images.

2002-04-25 05:43  robert

	* Added back in as binary file.

2002-04-25 05:42  robert

	* Temporily removing to change it to a binary file.

2002-04-24 20:57  robert

	* Merged Bob's changes for MacOSX build. This change is simply the
	  addition of
	  GLUT_LIB to the link line. This change should be removed once we
	  fixed the
	  OSG_LIBS so that it doens't include osgGLUT, however, I'll leave
	  this for another
	  day...

2002-04-24 20:36  robert

	* Fix for MacOSX build, making sure that the compresed tex image is
	  defined
	  on all builds by removing the #ifdef's but then changing the name
	  used
	  in the typedef so it doesn't collide with local implementations.

2002-04-24 20:32  robert

	* Updated doc++ docs once more.

2002-04-24 20:24  robert

	* Removed CullViewState from the distribution, moved
	  CullViewState::CullingMode
	  into CullVisitor, and then removed all references to
	  CullViewState from other
	  parts of the scene graph.

2002-04-24 20:13  robert

	* Updateds doc++ documention.

2002-04-24 20:04  robert

	* Changes for Mac OSX build, sent in by Bob Kuehne

2002-04-24 14:52  robert

	* Removed the use of __FUNCTION__ from MemoryManager to remove
	  problems with
	  VisualStudio .NET compile.
	  
	  Added support for OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL and OSG_FILE_PATH into the
	  relevant getenv
	  routines. This compliments the exisiting OSGNOTIFYLEVEL &
	  OSGFILEPATH which
	  are deprecated but still supported. The OSG_ version are more
	  consistent
	  with the rest of the env variables used in the OSG.

2002-04-24 14:14  robert

	* Updates to the documentation.

2002-04-24 13:08  robert

	* Moved doc/OpenSceneGraphBanner_Distribution.jpg to doc/images/ to
	  tidy up
	  the doc directory.

2002-04-24 13:05  robert

	* Updated the docs on compiling under Windows.

2002-04-23 15:05  robert

	* Added OSG_USE_MEMORY_MANAGER to Windows debug build

2002-04-23 15:01  robert

	* Fixed compilation problem associated wirh moving FileUtils source
	  out into
	  seperate files.

2002-04-23 14:58  robert

	* Fixed ordering of paramters in osg::Image constructor to remove
	  warning.

2002-04-23 13:59  robert

	* Seperated out the platform specific implementions of the file
	  search/access
	  routines - we now have FileUtils_Windows.cpp, FileUtils_Mac.cpp
	  and
	  FileUtils_Unix.cpp. The FileUtils_Mac.cpp is based on code
	  submitted
	  by Josh Portway and add uses the carbon API for searching for
	  files.

2002-04-23 13:12  robert

	* Addtional details on the OpenSceneGraph and support.

2002-04-23 11:03  robert

	  and not Cygwin/Mingw.

2002-04-23 11:02  robert

	* Added a pragma to get round a VisualStudio warning that I
	  couldn't fix
	  in any easy way.

2002-04-23 10:55  robert

	* Added an imageList.clear() to osgbillboard so that its memory
	  would be
	  cleared before entering the viewer main loop, this removes
	  memorymanager
	  a reported memory leak due to the viewer using exit() which
	  bypasses
	  the clean up on main itself.
	  
	  Added an osgNew to the ReaderWriterRGB.cpp to aid detected of
	  tracking of
	  memory leaks.

2002-04-23 10:34  robert

	* Fixed compile problems under VisualStudio w.r.t the new additions
	  for
	  precompiled mipmaps. Changed std::size_t to unsigned int.

2002-04-23 09:06  robert

	* Replaced texture compression extension define so that its #ifndef
	  guard used
	  GL_ARB_texture_compression as natured intended.

2002-04-23 08:40  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog in preperation for the 0.8.45 release.

2002-04-23 08:34  robert

	* Added to the NEWS file.

2002-04-23 08:29  robert

	* Fixed warning in swapBytes, simple addded unsigned to the int
	  loop count,
	  since sizeof() is always an unsigned int.

2002-04-22 23:54  don

	* Impleneted byte swap for use between machines with different
	  endians.

2002-04-22 21:45  don

	* Fixed couple of small errors caught by Solaris compiler

2002-04-22 21:18  robert

	* A couple of API additions to osg::ClippingVolume, osg::Matrix and
	  osg::Plane
	  sent in by Mike Connell.

2002-04-22 21:13  robert

	* Integrated submission from Boris Bralo:
	  
	  Supported added for precompiled mip maps stored in osg::Image,
	  and read
	  by osg::Texture.
	  
	  Updates to TerraPage loader for support of compressed texture
	  images and
	  precompiled mip maps.

2002-04-22 19:41  robert

	* Added code in hangglide to move the earth sky around with the eye
	  point,
	  use osg::Transform::ComputeTransformCallback.

2002-04-22 14:54  robert

	* Added support for compute the near and far planes and then
	  applying to
	  the current projection matrix into CullVisitor itself. Similar
	  code to
	  support this has been moved out of SceneView completely.
	  
	  Added Matrix:: infront of the definition of the static
	  osg::Matrix::inverse(Matrix) method which was missing.

2002-04-22 09:55  robert

	* Slight changes to FAQ to make a little more relevant, it really
	  needs
	  a total re-write though.

2002-04-22 09:50  robert

	* Added test script which runs all the demos in the OSG to make
	  sure they
	  run ok. User has to verify they are correct visually.

2002-04-22 09:37  robert

	* Cleaned up the handling of the Viewport with
	  osg::SceneView/RenderStage
	  and CullVisitor so that the Viewport is now managed as part as
	  the global
	  stateset so that it can be pushed and popped like the rest of
	  state without
	  problems. This makes it easier to have multiple viewports within
	  one
	  scene graph.

2002-04-22 09:31  robert

	* Fixes the .mlt loading from Ben Discoe.

2002-04-21 22:05  robert

	* Updated TODO list.
	  
	  Converted AnimationPath so it is now subclassed from
	  osg::Transform::ComputeTransfromCallback()
	  so that it can be directly attached to the scene to move objects
	  about.
	  
	  Changed the osg::SateSet::setGlobalDefaults() so that is sets
	  GL_DEPTH_TEST
	  to ON.
	  
	  Added guards and creation of default helper classes in
	  osgGLUT::Viewer and
	  osgUtil::SceneView so that sensible defaults are used when no
	  settings
	  are used of
	  osg::State/StateSet,osgUtil::RenderStage/RenderGraph/CullVisitor.

	  istrucions sit in the doc directory as html files.

2002-04-19 19:55  robert

	* Changed the implementation of
	  osg::Quat::makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) so that
	  it conforms to the OpenFlight convention of euler angles. Added
	  documentation
	  into Matrix and Quat to reflect this.
	  
	  Added so test code to osgcube for stress testing memory
	  allocation and deallocation.

	* Fixes for warnings under VisualStudio

2002-04-17 11:29  robert

	* Added a gset->computeNumVertices() which was missing, this was
	  causing models
	  to disappear after application of tri stripping.

2002-04-17 09:48  robert

	* Changed the osg::Billboard comution so that it get passed in the
	  current
	  modelview matrix rathan than an identity matrix, this matrix is
	  then modified
	  locally.
	  
	  Changed the osg::Matrix set methods so they are inline.
	  
	  Added a few useful comments to MemoryManager.cpp to help people
	  understand
	  the assert's better.

2002-04-16 21:39  don

	* Changed Linux makedepend flag from -MM to -M

2002-04-16 21:08  robert

	  to edit
	  the DIRS cruft in a single file in the Make directory instead of
	  having
	  to edit multiple files. Also edited Makefiles that needed to
	  include
	  this file.
	  
	  Also cleaned up txp loader to compile with SunOS. This needs to
	  be retested
	  on other platforms.

2002-04-16 14:57  robert

	* Added osg::Image::setPixelFormat(..) and
	  setInternalTextureFormat(), and
	  renamed osg::Image::pixelFormat(),
	  internalTextureFormat(),dataType() to
	  osg::Image::getPixelFormat() etc. These changes are to bring it
	  more
	  into line with the style of the rest of the OSG.
	  
	  Updated the rest of the distribution to take account for these
	  names changes.

2002-04-16 14:09  robert

	* Purge on warnings under Linux.

2002-04-16 11:41  robert

	* Removed the cached matrices from osg::Camera, so that
	  osg::Camrea::getModelViewMatrix() and
	  osg::Camera::getProjectionMatrix() are
	  calculated on the fly. Removed various redudent methods,
	  including the
	  project and unproject methods which are better supported within
	  osgUtil::SceneView.
	  
	  Added a computeWindowMatrix() method to Viewport, to make it
	  easier to construct
	  a MV*P*W matrix for converting local coords into screen coords
	  and visa versa.
	  Converted SceneView and CullVisitor to use this new method.

2002-04-16 11:36  robert

	* Updates to the flt plugin from Brede Johansen.

	* Added Makefile.inst which was not added ealier with the check in
	  osghud.

2002-04-15 14:45  don

	* Added Daniel Sjölie's request to use a default complier (CXX) in
	  makedefs.
	  Doing this only for Linux

2002-04-15 14:29  robert

	* Fixed error in project w.r.t name of source file.

2002-04-15 14:21  robert

	* Fixes to warning in Win32 build

2002-04-15 08:51  robert

	* Fixed the copying of LongIDRecord's strings in flt plugin so it
	  now uses the record length-4,
	  to create the string. Also Removed some in appropriate comments
	  from LongIDRecord, since they
	  were obvious and hang over of a copy and paste job on the code.

2002-04-15 08:09  robert

	* Fixed display problem with the HUD in osgtext which was caused by
	  the
	  new mods to SceneView not honouring the z near/far calculation
	  flag.

2002-04-14 22:21  robert

	* Added support for specificing the eye mapping and seperation
	  between the
	  horizontal and veritical split stereo modes.
	  
	  Renamed osg::Image::ensureDimensionArePowerOfTwo() to
	  osg::Image::ensureValidSizeForTexturing().

2002-04-14 20:30  robert

	* Used a faster method for checking for power of 2 on the image
	  dimensions and
	  did a check on forcing 16bits textures in osg::Texture (which
	  speeds things
	  up on the Umea model which is performance bound by texture
	  memory.), the
	  later check is now commented out.

2002-04-14 13:41  robert

	* Fixes to osg::Image::createImage(..), and addition of code to
	  Viewer.cpp to support

	* Clean up for VisualStudio build

2002-04-13 18:53  robert

	* Added a space into the project name because it was confusing
	  VisualStudio.

2002-04-13 18:45  robert

	* Further changes to VisualStudio.dsw for dependancies.

2002-04-13 11:36  robert

	* Added dependanices into osgPlugins.

2002-04-13 11:08  robert

	* Fixed compile problem related to missing includes (a result of
	  removing include of Camera..)

2002-04-13 10:29  robert

	* Added dependancies to Demos.

2002-04-13 10:18  robert

	* Saved workspace from VisualStudio to follow up on missing demo
	  dependancies

2002-04-13 09:28  robert

	* Added Core infront of the names of the project dependancies.

2002-04-12 18:06  robert

	* Further work on cleaning up SceneView and Camera, in particular
	  moving strereo
	  support out of Camera and into SceneView. Also enabled the option
	  to set the
	  projection and modelview matrices directly on SceneView thereby
	  removing the
	  dependance on osg::Camrea to control the view of the scene.

2002-04-12 14:05  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build.

2002-04-12 13:06  robert

	* Futher updates to VisualStudio files, adding osgstereoimage and
	  osgversion in particular.

2002-04-12 12:51  robert

	* Added "Core " infront of the osg, osgDB, osgUtil, osgText, and
	  osgGLUT libraries
	  in the Visual Studio workspace/project files.

2002-04-12 12:15  robert

	* Renamed the osgtext demo project to reflect the name.

2002-04-12 11:57  robert

	* Added "Demo " and "osgPlugin " infront of all demo and plugin
	  project names to
	  help differentiate them within VisualStudio.

2002-04-12 10:24  robert

	* Attempt to add osgPlugin infront of the 3ds name to force
	  VisualStudio to
	  present it as plugin in the browser.

2002-04-12 10:12  robert

	* Reorganised the names of libraries and Demos to make it clear
	  what is what.

2002-04-12 09:53  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build

2002-04-12 09:25  robert

	* Removed double reference of osgtexture

2002-04-12 09:25  robert

	* Removed Metroweks files since they wern't being used, and were
	  not up to
	  date. An attempt at using Metrowerks for MacOSX build failed, and
	  we
	  have Cywgin/Mingwin VisualStudio for windows so there is little
	  need for it.

2002-04-12 08:01  robert

	* Removed dangling references to NewCullVisitor from osgUtil.dsp.

2002-04-12 06:18  don

	* Solaris PKG distribution now makes a shar (self-extracting shell
	  archived)
	  changed makepgk to do this.
	  
	  Changed another one of those pesky cout = std::cout in
	  CullVisitor.cpp

2002-04-12 05:09  don

	* added 'make cleandepend' to build system.

2002-04-12 05:06  don

	* Added the 'make cleandepend' target to the build system.

2002-04-11 23:20  robert

	* Added DataVariance enum and set/get fields to osg::Object to help
	  identify
	  which objects have values that vary over the lifetime of the
	  object (DYNAMIC)
	  and ones that do not vary (STATIC). Removed the equivalent code
	  in
	  osg::Transform, StateSet and StateAttribute, as these are now
	  encompassed
	  by the new DataVariance field.
	  
	  Removed MatrixMode enum from Matrix, and associated
	  fields/parameters from
	  osg::Transfrom and osg::NodeVisitor, since MatrixMode was not
	  providing
	  any useful functionality, but made the interface more complex
	  (MatrixMode
	  was an experimental API)
	  
	  Added ReferenceFrame field to osg::Transform which allows users
	  to specify
	  transforms that are relative to their parents (the default, and
	  previous behavior)
	  or absolute reference frame, which can be used for HUD's, camera
	  relative
	  light sources etc etc. Note, the view frustum culling for
	  absolute Transform
	  are disabled, and all their parents up to the root are also
	  automatically
	  have view frustum culling disabled. However, once passed an
	  absolute Transform
	  node culling will return to its default state of on, so you can
	  still cull
	  underneath an absolute transform, its only the culling above
	  which is disabled.

2002-04-11 17:15  robert

	* Added several new methods to osg::Image to help keep track of
	  memory and added
	  osg::Image::readPixels to encapsulate glReadPixels.
	  
	  Reordering of includes in include/osg/Fog and include/osg/Light
	  to remove silly warnings under Visual Studio.

2002-04-11 17:13  robert

	* Patch to ReadWriter3DS from Mike Connel.

2002-04-11 16:05  don

	* Backed out bad addition of NewCUllVisitor

2002-04-11 15:54  don

	* Somehow, cvs forgot to check in a modified Makefile with
	  NewCullVisitor added
	  to it... Hm.. anyway this fixes it.

2002-04-11 13:53  robert

	* Fix for Win32 build.

2002-04-11 09:16  robert

	* Changed the comments for Clay Fowlwer about the GLU patch for
	  RedHat7.2 to
	  reflect the new position of the tarball and its new name.

2002-04-11 08:24  robert

	* Fixed refrences to NewCullVisitor which has now been mapped onto
	  CullVisitor.

2002-04-10 22:10  robert

	* Copied NewCullVisitor over top of CullVisitor and then removed
	  NewCullVisitor.
	  
	  Added some defines to Image in prep for writing code to determine
	  how big a
	  pixel is.

2002-04-10 21:51  robert

	* Added new osg::DrawPixels class with encapsulates glDrawPixels as
	  and
	  osg::Drawable. Added osg::Image::readPixels to osg::Image.
	  
	  Made osg::LightSource to default to cullActive set to false to
	  that LightSource
	  nodes don't get culled by default.

2002-04-10 14:34  don

	* Added placeholder .README file to the PKG directory to keep CVS
	  from removing
	  the directory on an update.

2002-04-10 14:32  don

	* Removed big honkin' SUN PKG files from cvs distribution.

2002-04-10 01:29  don

	* Added (previously omitted) libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, libgif to
	  makedefs
	  in the Linux section

2002-04-09 22:54  don

	* Fixed makedepend to do the right thing.

2002-04-09 21:46  robert

	* Added setProjectionMatrix and setModelViewMatrix() methods to
	  osg::SceneView,
	  and associated member variables. I have not linked them up to the
	  cull traversal yet, but this will be the next task.

2002-04-09 16:09  robert

	* Further work on removing Camera references from NewCullVisitor
	  and releted
	  classes, this work paves the way for making osg::Camera an
	  optional
	  extra rather than a requirement for rendering.

2002-04-09 15:51  don

	* Checking in all Makefile.inst in src/Demos/*. These are the
	  Makefiles
	  that get installed rather than the build Makefiles.

2002-04-09 14:55  don

	* Added pkgadd distribution for Solaris.
	  
	  Added a cleaner way to install demo source so that installed
	  versions use a
	  simplified makedefs/makerules.
	  
	  Small fix to get osgText to compile with Solaris CC. Constructor
	  declared
	  with a non-const argument, but implemented with const argument.

2002-04-08 16:50  don

	* Added -lstdc++ to begining of LIBS on link line.. ??

2002-04-08 16:25  don

	* Put quotes around "DBGF" for multi argument

2002-04-08 08:23  robert

	* Changed a char* into const char* to fix Solaris build.

2002-04-08 08:22  robert

	* Fix for VisualStudio's lack of auto_ptr::reset.

2002-04-07 17:47  don

	* Added a stop gap fix for cygwin build. Previous experiements were
	  creating
	  library and plugin files that looked like system library and
	  system files
	  which would have deleted original files on a 'make install'.
	  Cygwin is not
	  tested yet, but this needed to get fixed before a cygwin user
	  wiped out his
	  system library files.

2002-04-06 09:24  robert

	* Updates to Makefile to reflect recent .cpp additions such as
	  TextureCubeMap,
	  MemoryManager etc.

2002-04-05 02:49  don

	* Fixed a small oversight in the previous bug fix. in
	  GeoSet::computeBound()
	  _numcoords is NOT necesarily _cindex._size.

2002-04-05 01:52  don

	* Edited INSTALL for new make and installation procedures.
	  Checking in a fix for Norman Vine
	  Added helprules and help.sh for a long-winded help message if you
	  'make help'.

2002-04-04 18:01  don

	* Added Norman Vine's changes for CYGWIN builds
	  
	  Added distrules and makerpms for building RPM distributions
	  
	  Removed old RedHatRPM distribution build directory
	  
	  Added new dist/RPM directory and placed temporary .spec files
	  (these
	  are generated by Make/makerpms and are not intended for
	  stand-alone
	  use, but they keep the directory warm and CVS happy)

2002-04-04 00:30  don

	* Fixed a small bug in compute bound that caused it to come up with
	  the
	  wrong number if the coord array was indexed, and containing bogus
	  (unindexed, yet in-line) numbers.

2002-04-03 17:53  don

	* Cleaned up in stallation directives

2002-04-03 17:42  don

	* Reinstated Norman Vine's TARGET_BASENAME variable in the
	  makefiles and
	  added prefixes and suffixes to libs and plugins. ALl this to
	  accomodate
	  cygwin...
	  
	  Also added INST_SYS_PREFIX and INST_SHARE_PREFIX for
	  installation, as well
	  as "standardizing" the install locations for the various
	  platforms.

2002-04-02 06:58  don

	* Oops forgot to add makedefs and makerules

2002-04-02 06:44  don

	* The new order for building OSG. All Makefiles are replaced and
	  the Make directory is left with four files only :
	  makedefs
	  makerules
	  makedirrules
	  instrules
	  
	  These work for all platforms supported so far, which include :
	  Linux
	  Irix
	  Solaris
	  MacOSX
	  Cygwin
	  FreeBSD

2002-04-02 06:27  don

	* Folded in Bob Kuehne's changes for Mac OSX to makedefs and
	  makerules

2002-04-01 15:37  don

	* Added cleanlite rules to makerules.new

2002-04-01 04:54  don

	* *** empty log message ***

2002-04-01 03:39  don

	* Completed and tested instrules.new

2002-03-31 16:43  don

	* Added more to instrules and makedefs.new Folded in Randall
	  Hopper's
	  changes for FreeBSD

2002-03-31 16:40  robert

	* Added new osg::Projection node, and osgUtil::NewCullVisitor which
	  are work
	  in progress for the new support for controlling the projection
	  matrix from
	  within the scene graph.
	  
	  Also Added osg::State::getClippingVolume(), getProjectionMatrix()
	  and
	  getModelViewMatrix() with allows drawables to access the current
	  projection,
	  and model view matrices and the view frustum in local coords to
	  the drawable.

2002-03-31 09:54  robert

	* Removed reference to malloc.h, replacing by stdlib.h instead.

2002-03-30 21:20  robert

	* Warnings fixes, submitted by Randall Hopper.

2002-03-30 15:13  robert

	* Fix for Cygwin build.

2002-03-29 17:26  robert

	* Move the applying of Projection and ModelView matrices into
	  osg::State so that
	  it now maintains references to the last applied matrices,
	  automatically doing
	  lazy state updating. This simplifies the various places in the
	  OSG which
	  were previously doing the applying, add paves the way for
	  managing the
	  projection matrix within the scene graph.
	  
	  Remove MemoryAdapter and mem_ptr as they arn't being used, and
	  can potentially
	  confuse users by their existance.

2002-03-29 12:23  robert

	* Converted from dos file endings to unix.

2002-03-29 12:23  robert

	* Fixes for dos endings in MemoryManager.cpp, and compile fix for
	  osgText for
	  Cygwin.

2002-03-29 06:54  don

	* Added new install rules for makefiles and updated makedefs and
	  makerules... more to come

2002-03-28 23:06  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build.

2002-03-28 07:29  don

	* Couple a fixes in makedefs and makerules

2002-03-28 06:35  don

	* Added Norman Vines fixeds for cygwin

2002-03-27 23:04  robert

	* A compile fix to the new Texture subload changes.

2002-03-27 22:51  robert

	* Added support for setting the texture subload width and height
	  within
	  osg::Texture. The values default to 0, and in this state they are
	  sizes of the glTexSubImage2D are taken from the source image
	  size. This
	  allows the previous setup with no settings for subload size to
	  work as
	  before.

2002-03-27 16:31  robert

	* Futher updates to MemoryManager, fixed memory leak in osgconv.

2002-03-27 14:56  robert

	* Updates to various files, replacing delete calls with osgDelete
	  so that
	  greater debugging info can be gleaned.

2002-03-27 10:52  robert

	* Added support for VERTICAL_SPILT and HORIZONTAL_SPLIT stereo
	  modes.

2002-03-27 06:09  don

	* Update to makeefs/makerules

2002-03-27 00:55  don

	* update to makedefs.new makerules.new

2002-03-26 23:52  robert

	* Added support for osg::MemoryManager which is based upon Paul
	  Nettle's
	  memory manager published at flipcode.com. This can be turned on
	  with the OSG_USE_MEMORY_MANGER option which then uses custom
	  global
	  new and delete operators as well as provide osgNew and osgDelete
	  macro's
	  which add ability to log line and file from which calls are made.
	  
	  Updated osg,osgUtil,osgDB,osgText and osgPlugins/osg to use
	  osgNew/osgDelete,
	  and fixed memory leaks highlighted by the new memory manager.

2002-03-26 21:26  don

	* Adding makedirrrules to Make directory

2002-03-26 21:24  don

	* Temporarily adding makedefs.new and makerules.new to keep them
	  separate from current makedefs/makerules files. Will eventually
	  remove all makedefs.* and makerules.* and replace only makedefs
	  and makerules with makedefs.new and makedefs.new

2002-03-25 23:18  robert

	* Added osg::MemoryManger which is currently based on Paul Nettle's
	  memory manager
	  published at flipcode. I havn't adopted Paul's macro's for
	  new/delete etc, but use
	  osg prefixed versions instead to allow greater flexiblity in
	  handling include
	  ordering.
	  
	  Have fixed a couple of new/delete[] problems which existed as a
	  result.
	  
	  To use the MemoryManager to track memory usage simply add
	  -DOSG_USE_MEMEORY_TRACKING to the compile line.
	  
	  Have yet to move the osg from using new to osgNew, will do this
	  next.

2002-03-25 23:13  robert

	* Added missing osgstereoimage.dsp

2002-03-25 19:04  robert

	* Fixes for MacOSX build.

2002-03-23 21:30  robert

	* Fixed warning in DisplaySettings.cpp

2002-03-23 21:28  robert

	* Moved the exit on escape into Window, and added a virtual free
	  method on both
	  Window an Viewer to clean up the windows, this is now called
	  before exit is
	  finally called, ensure that more more memroy is clean up prior to
	  exit.

2002-03-23 10:55  robert

	* Added GL_TEXTURE_3D definition for those with gl.h headers which
	  don't
	  contain it.

2002-03-21 15:46  robert

	* Added missing TextureCubeMap.cpp to cvs.

2002-03-21 12:36  robert

	* Renamed have_applied_mode, have_applied_attribute, apply_mode,
	  apply_attribute
	  to haveAppliedMode, haveAppliedAttribute, applyMode,
	  applyAttribute to make
	  it more consistent with the general OSG name convetion.

2002-03-21 12:00  robert

	* Added osg:State:have_applied_mode(mode) and
	  have_applied_attribute(type) to make it
	  easier to specify which modes and attributes have been modified
	  without
	  the user requiring to know to what value, or to have an
	  equivilant attribute
	  to pass to the have_applied_attribute method. The original
	  have_applied(mode)
	  and have_applied(attribute) methods have been renamed
	  have_applied_mode(),
	  have_applied_attribute() as this was required to prevent the mode
	  and type
	  values colliding during compile (it was causing a compile error
	  when the method
	  names were the same.)

2002-03-21 11:57  robert

	* _cullMaskRight was not being initialized in the constructor which
	  was
	  resulting in some sporadic problems when running stereo -
	  occoasionally the
	  right eye view wouldn't appear!

2002-03-21 07:50  don

	* Modified files reflect small changes to work with Sun OS port....
	  
	  Removed redundant README file in osgviews... was a copy of
	  sgv/README.

2002-03-20 22:39  robert

	* Added osg::TextureCubeMap which encapsulates OpenGL's cube
	  texture mapping.

2002-03-20 14:03  robert

	* Added a Referenced::unref_nodelete() method which unreferences
	  but does
	  not delete the object even if its count goes to 0 or below. This
	  should
	  only be called in special circumstances, the
	  ReaderWriter::ReadResult
	  being one of them. This new method has allowed the problem of
	  objects
	  being multiple referenced on return from readNodeFile() &
	  readImageFile().

2002-03-20 11:24  robert

	* Updates to Texture and TextureCubeMap to clean up the code so
	  they share
	  much more of the core texture setup code. This largely invloved
	  paramterizing
	  the applyImmediateMode, which has also been rename applyTexImage
	  to reflect
	  its functionality better.

2002-03-20 11:22  robert

	* Added the fallback of intersecting with the a drawables bounding
	  box, if the drawable
	  isn't a GeoSet and hence supported by the IntersectVisitor's
	  GeoSet primitive
	  intersections code.

2002-03-18 23:10  robert

	* Added osg::TextureCubeMap. submission from Brede Johansen.

2002-03-18 22:03  robert

	* Fixed the MS version number check in Optiizer.cpp. Fixes to
	  memory handling
	  in ReaderWriterDW.cpp. Submissions from Geoff Michel.

2002-03-18 21:56  don

	* Changes required for SUN Solaris port...

2002-03-17 18:44  robert

	* Added new osgstereoimage demo which loads two stero paired images
	  to create
	  a 3D via of photographed scene.

2002-03-14 23:19  robert

	* Fix of a delete char array so it used delete [].

2002-03-14 20:29  don

	* Fixed a problem for finding MIPS 64 bit libraries. Was seaching
	  for
	  LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY64_PATH

2002-03-14 17:34  robert

	* Integrated various changes worked on at the Glasgow Science
	  Center. Changes
	  include change the CameraManipulators so they work with double
	  for time
	  instead of float. Also added support for DataType to
	  osg::StateAttribute
	  and StateSet so that they can be set to either STATIC or DYNAMIC,
	  this
	  allows the optimizer to know whether that an attribute can be
	  optimized
	  or not.

2002-03-14 16:42  robert

	* Added a TextureCallback which cycles through various filter
	  modes, used
	  in testing new glTextParamters update functionality. I have
	  commented out
	  the call to attaching of the callback so osgtexture outwardly
	  behaves as
	  before. The code lies dormant just incase we need to use it for
	  testing
	  in the future.

2002-03-14 16:01  robert

	* Changed Texture so that is use lazy updating on texture paramters
	  (Filter/Wrap)
	  mode by using a _texParamtersDirty flag in combination with an
	  applyTexParamters(State&) method which does the paramters setting
	  in one
	  tidy bundle. This new implementations replaces the CompileFlags
	  submitted
	  yesterday.
	  
	  Simplified NodeCallback by remove osg::NodeCallback::Requirements
	  as they
	  are no longer needed.
	  
	  Fixed comments in Drawable.
	  
	  Put guards around cosf definations so that they are only used
	  under Win32/Mac.
	  
	  Fixed warning in CullVisitor.

2002-03-14 15:26  robert

	* Fix to handling of big/little endian in trpage_readbuf sent in by
	  Randall Hopper,
	  and a waning fix.

2002-03-14 00:07  don

	* Fixed compile flags in Texture

2002-03-13 22:44  don

	* Fixed DrawCallback in Drawable and added CullCallback to Drawable
	  Cull Visitor now checks for a Drawable's CullCallback and calls
	  it
	  if it exists. It then prunes based on the return value (bool) of
	  the
	  cull callback.

2002-03-09 10:54  robert

	* Support added for pivot points, submission from Mike Connel.

2002-03-09 10:53  robert

	* Fixed setWindowWidth call to account for width and height
	  correctly.

2002-03-09 10:52  robert

	* TXP plugin updates from Boris Bralo.

2002-03-09 10:52  robert

	* TXP plugin changes submitted by Boris Bralo.

2002-03-09 10:51  robert

	* TXP plugin update from Boris Bralo.

2002-03-04 01:37  robert

	* Added file extension guard to .obj reader plugin.

2002-03-03 22:31  robert

	* Added support for seperate traversal masks for standard, left and
	  right
	  cull traversals. This allows one to create seperate rendering for
	  left
	  and right eyes when doing stereo.

2002-03-02 09:24  robert

	* Added a GL vesion number check to LightModel, and small typo fix
	  in Registry.

2002-03-01 09:29  robert

	* Added getInverse implementation to AnimationPath, and added #if
	  guard
	  to Optimizer.cpp to all compilation on state optimizer when using
	  VS7.

2002-03-01 09:28  robert

	* Fixes to osgText to improve robustness when running multithreaded
	  multipipe
	  apps.

2002-03-01 09:27  robert

	* Updates to the clamp to border support in osg::Texture.

2002-02-28 00:11  robert

	* Added support for setting the maximum number of graphics contexts
	  that the
	  OSG has to maintian.

2002-02-27 22:12  robert

	* Added an using namespace osg to fix a MipsPro7.3 build error.

2002-02-27 22:04  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS file with Boris' email address.

2002-02-27 22:00  robert

	* Integrated support for GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_ARB extension to
	  osg::Texture,
	  submitted by Sasa Bistrovic.

2002-02-27 21:57  robert

	* Fixes to DW loader, submitted by Geoff Michel.

2002-02-27 00:58  robert

	* Added new osg::AnimationPath which is contaner for a set of key
	  frames for
	  defining an animation path. To be used with osg::Transform etc.

2002-02-26 20:01  robert

	* Added makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) to Quat in prep for new
	  classes for
	  animation paths.

2002-02-25 23:14  robert

	* Added LightModel.cpp's to Codewarrior files and added
	  definiations for pre gl version 1.2 headers lack of support for
	  color control.

2002-02-25 22:46  robert

	* Added support for glLightModel functionality via osg::LightModel.

2002-02-24 23:03  robert

	* Updated docs, ChangLog and NEW for patched version of 0.8.44.

2002-02-24 22:39  robert

	* Added LineStipple to mcp file.

2002-02-24 20:55  robert

	* Added support for glLineStipple via osg::LineStipple state
	  attribute.

2002-02-24 20:21  robert

	* Removed Metrowerks.mcp as it has not been kept up to date since
	  October,
	  the new OpenSceneGraph.mcp replaces it.

2002-02-24 16:49  robert

	* Integrated fixes to the detailed depth calculation in the
	  CullVisitor from
	  Sasa, and fix to the IntersectVisitor's management of path from
	  Sean.

2002-02-23 00:16  robert

	* Updates to Windows Codwarrior file

2002-02-22 23:40  robert

	* updates for Win32 Codewarrior build

2002-02-22 23:39  robert

	* Fix for win32 Codewarrior build

2002-02-22 17:12  robert

	* Add support for Metrowerks Codewarrior build under Windows.

2002-02-19 18:59  robert

	* fixed txp build name problem - was overwriting .osg plugin.

2002-02-18 23:01  robert

	* Fixed stereo implementation.

2002-02-18 21:52  robert

	* Fixes to Win32 build of new DX writer plugin.

2002-02-18 20:48  robert

	* Comment w.r.t OpenDX plugin updated.

2002-02-18 20:46  robert

	* Added OpenDX writer from Randall Hopper.

2002-02-14 13:26  robert

	* Beginings of reimplementation of stereo support in scene view.
	  Work
	  not complete yet.

2002-02-14 12:55  robert

	* updated the options for the txp plugin.

2002-02-14 12:51  robert

	* Removed osgWX workspace files.

2002-02-14 11:06  robert

	* Fixed impostor bug introduced when new modelview matrix was moved
	  entirely
	  within the cull traversal/draw traversal. The impostor code has
	  been adapted
	  to the new convention.

2002-02-13 22:56  robert

	* Updated the makefiles to all have the #!gmake reference to force
	  IRIX
	  compilation using gmake rather than pmake or smake. This gets
	  round
	  issues with exporting OSGHOME.

2002-02-13 22:53  robert

	* Updated the osgconv support for orientation conversion so that it
	  used
	  inserted a static transform to do the work of rotating the scene,
	  then
	  applied a standard
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlattenStaticTransformsVisitor
	  traversal to flatten the transfrom down on to the geometry nodes.

2002-02-13 22:52  robert

	* Fixed the fabsf define which was eroneous mapped to sqrtf, due to
	  the copy and
	  paste antipattern no doubt.

2002-02-13 00:13  robert

	* Fixed problems with intersection visitor coupled with the viewer.

2002-02-13 00:00  robert

	* Added sgv -stereo cessna.osg to make test list.

2002-02-12 23:49  robert

	* Added a set of test runs to the makefiles and demos. The demos
	  now have
	  titles relevenat to their function.

2002-02-12 22:51  robert

	* Updates for IRIX build, and docs updates.

2002-02-12 22:35  robert

	* Removed references to osgWX from the doc++ directory.

2002-02-12 08:23  robert

	* Updates to Transform and CullVistor to support new
	  getLocalToWorldMatrix methods.

2002-02-11 23:24  robert

	* Updates to Transform handling in CullVisitor, in prep for moving
	  camera
	  modelview and projection into Transform nodes.

2002-02-11 22:53  robert

	* Clean up of TXP plugin for IRIX build.

2002-02-11 19:51  robert

	* Cleand up the root Makefile.
	  
	  Moved CullVisitor/RenderStage/RenderStageLighting across to
	  managing lights
	  entirely within RenderStageLighting, and changed the management
	  of modelview
	  matrices so that RenderLeaf now stores the absolute modelview
	  matrix, rather
	  than a model matrix as done previously. The later allows
	  RenderLeaf's to do
	  a glLoadMatrix rather than a
	  glPushMatrix/glMultMatrix/glPopMatrix.

2002-02-11 15:09  robert

	* Fixed Linux hang of the TXP loader by overriding the default -O2
	  optimization
	  level which appears to cause the code to hang, -O works fine for
	  some strange
	  reason, I havn't found any direct problems in the code. This may
	  be compiler
	  bug or a code bug, the bug may go away in later versions of
	  GNUC++, the
	  problem currently occurs under GCC2.96.

2002-02-11 12:51  robert

	* Applied fix to transparancy in flt loader.

2002-02-11 03:26  robert

	* Fixed the date on the release.

2002-02-11 02:38  robert

	* Updated changelog for release.

2002-02-11 02:34  robert

	* Fixed a make install error on the plugins related to the old
	  definitions for
	  plugin names hanging around despite being deprecated. These
	  definiations
	  confused the make install/make instclean so it tried to link a
	  non existant
	  library. Have removed old definitions and everything intalls
	  properly once
	  more:-)

2002-02-11 01:02  robert

	* Updated changelog.

2002-02-11 00:51  robert

	* Did a make docs, in prep for the 0.8.44 release.

2002-02-11 00:42  robert

	* Added missing doc++ generated .html files.

2002-02-11 00:40  robert

	* Updated Stats code, sent in by Geof Michel.

2002-02-11 00:23  robert

	* Clean up INSTALL notes.

2002-02-10 23:19  robert

	* Updateds NEWS for the 0.8.44 release.
	  
	  Change the osg::NodeVisitor::getLocalToWorldMatrix() /
	  getWorldToLocalMatrix() methods so it do not initilize the matrix
	  being
	  passed to them, and assume the the users has already initiliazed
	  them
	  appropriately, such as to take account of camera positions.

2002-02-10 22:35  robert

	* Implemented NodeVisitor's getLocalToWorldMatrix and
	  getWorldToLocalMatrix
	  to allow users to querry the current accumulated matrix state
	  within the
	  scene graph.

2002-02-10 20:05  robert

	* Disbalbed a dumb warning in Windows build via a #pragma.

2002-02-10 17:16  robert

	* Fixed a bug in the drive manipulator which was due to it using
	  the local
	  coords of the intersection point with the scene rather than the
	  world
	  coord value for that point. The code now uses
	  osgUtil::Hit::getWorldIntersectionPoint() method for getting the
	  world coords.
	  
	  Added support for getWorldIntersectionPoint to Viewer.cpp.
	  
	  Put and #ifdef around the setting of the default display list
	  visitor so
	  it nolonger sets in under IRIX. This is a world around to the IR
	  graphics
	  imbending lighting info into display lists, if the display lists
	  are
	  created before state is set up it produces lighting artifacts
	  such as
	  flickering. Remove the the default display list init visitor
	  removes
	  these problems, display lists are then built on the fly and
	  drawables
	  a drawn for the first time.

2002-02-10 11:17  robert

	* Fixes for MacOSX build.

2002-02-10 10:42  robert

	* Fixes to TXP loader for Cygwin and Ming builds.

2002-02-09 22:29  robert

	* Fixed the osgUtil::Optimizer::FlattenStaticTransformVisitor so
	  that it
	  does not flatten drawables which have double references to them,
	  but only
	  one reference with a static transform on it. This case can't be
	  flattened
	  but this wasn't picked up. The code now detects the case
	  correctly.

2002-02-09 21:29  robert

	* Updates to BMP loader from Geoff Michel.

2002-02-09 19:46  robert

	* Added std:: infront of string refrences to solve compile problems
	  under gcc 3.0.3.
	  
	  Also converted to unix file endings so other the windows style
	  files.

2002-02-09 14:29  robert

	* Updates to docs and fixes to a few warnings.

2002-02-09 10:54  robert

	* Updated docs.

2002-02-09 10:50  robert

	* Fix to BMP loader.

2002-02-09 10:24  robert

	* Fixes for cygwin and mingw builds.

2002-02-08 23:07  robert

	* Removed further wxsgv files.

2002-02-08 23:04  robert

	* Removed osgWX and wxsgv from the repositry as it is intend to
	  keep the core
	  distribution clean from GUI examples, these instead should live
	  in the bazaar.
	  This can better accomodate the many different types of viewer
	  that users are
	  developming.

2002-02-08 22:55  robert

	* Added support for parents to Drawables.
	  
	  Bumped up version numbers in prep for 0.8.44.

2002-02-08 09:30  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX and Boris Bralo's TerraPage loader.

2002-02-07 08:07  robert

	* Fixed teh setDrawCallback so that it now calls dirtyDisplayList()
	  instead of
	  dirtyBound.

2002-02-07 01:17  robert

	* Fix for Win32 build.

2002-02-07 01:15  robert

	* Various investigations into culling errors w.r.t matrix inversion
	  resulted in
	  the conclusion that the osg::Matrix::inverse was broken, have
	  lifted a new
	  implementation from sgl and it seems to work fine. Will need
	  further testing
	  but looks good.

2002-02-07 01:12  robert

	* Fix for the handling of lighting in the DW loader.

2002-02-07 01:11  robert

	* Added a check to the destructor of Referenced so that it detects
	  referenced
	  objects that are deleted whilest still having a positive
	  _refCount, such
	  as when a object has been deleted on the stack, yet other
	  references still
	  exist for it. Have put the desctructor implementation in
	  Object.cpp to
	  avoid adding yet another file with only a couple of lines of code
	  in.

2002-02-07 01:07  robert

	* Added callbacks to allow users to modify the underlying
	  functionality of
	  LOD, Billboard and Drawabel objects.

2002-02-07 01:05  robert

	* Added extensions code submitted by Yefrei.

2002-02-06 08:57  robert

	* Compile fixes.

2002-02-05 21:54  robert

	* Have taken a few more steps towards support for view dependant
	  transformations
	  by adding a ComputeTransformCallback to osg::Transform, and have
	  now removed
	  the recently added AutoTransform since it is nolonger required.
	  Have also
	  updated CullVisitor to account for the new ways for tracking
	  transformation
	  matrices in the scene.

2002-02-05 21:51  robert

	* Have removed the old lazy initialization of Matrix since it was
	  causing bugs
	  and adding checks to many mothods which in the end slow it down
	  more than
	  not intilizing the code! The code is now simpler, more robust and
	  faster:-)

2002-02-05 10:49  robert

	* Added comment to flt2osg's handling of osg::Material setup w.r.t
	  osg::Material::_colorMode.

2002-02-03 22:32  don

	* added shademodel to TARGET_INCLUDE_FILES

2002-02-03 20:57  robert

	* Added beginings of new AutoTransform class.

2002-02-03 19:18  robert

	* Fixes for GCC 3.0.3 build.

2002-02-03 12:33  robert

	* Removed the trailing ; after namespace {...} declariations in
	  headers
	  which was being picked as a warning under Codewarrior.

2002-02-03 11:38  robert

	* Added first cut at new AutoTransform node which will be used for
	  generating
	  Transform's during the cull traversal such as for earth/sky etc.

2002-02-03 11:35  robert

	* Updates for Borland compilation.

2002-02-02 20:07  robert

	* Added defined( __BCPLUSPLUS__) to windows export code segments.

2002-02-02 19:49  robert

	* Fixed a copy and paste error which was causing compile problems
	  under Windows,
	  due to a incorrect comparison of objects of different types.

2002-02-02 10:52  robert

	* Typo fixed in the header guard.

2002-01-30 19:59  robert

	* Fixed clone(CopyOp&) and cloneType() methods which were out of
	  sync with the
	  new style clone operations.

2002-01-30 18:59  robert

	* Fixes for Windows build

2002-01-30 16:24  robert

	* Fixes for Windows build.

2002-01-30 15:27  robert

	* Removed the M_PI defines from include/osg/Math and have use a
	  const double osg::PI etc
	  in its place.

2002-01-30 15:02  robert

	* Changes for Borland C++ compiler changes.

2002-01-30 15:02  robert

	* Added osgbillboard project files to the VisualStudio workspace.

2002-01-30 15:01  robert

	* Added osgbillboard demo. The code is main a copy of osgtexture
	  right now,
	  my plan to do change it to make it a better demo of the different
	  types
	  of billboard that one can do.

2002-01-30 14:37  robert

	* Removed a Makedepend that didn't belong!

2002-01-30 13:15  robert

	* Fixed the rotation direction of the POINT_ROT_* modes, this was
	  broken by
	  earlier fixes to the osg::Matrix.

2002-01-30 12:09  robert

	* Made the LineSegment destructor protected to force users to
	  create segments
	  on the stack thus ensure that they arn't created locally and have
	  their
	  memory deleted incorrectly.
	  
	  Also updated the IntersectVisitor so that it no used
	  osg::ref_ptr<> internally
	  for storing all data. Have also move the IntersectState helper
	  class to inside the
	  IntersectVisitor which simplifies the external interface to the
	  class.

2002-01-29 20:25  robert

	* Fixes for windows build.

2002-01-29 14:20  robert

	* Removed the now rendundent DeepCopy and ShallowCopy files.

2002-01-29 14:04  robert

	* Moved all references to osg::Cloner to osg::CopyOp.

2002-01-29 12:55  robert

	* Fixed the header guard, which was using the name define as
	  FileUtils.
	  Problem spotted by Terry Welsh.

2002-01-29 12:52  robert

	* Have add new osg::CopyOp which replaces last nights osg::Cloner,
	  the new
	  class now combines Cloner and DeepCopy into one class. Cloner and
	  DeepCopy
	  will be removed in next commit.
	  
	  Also have added osgcopy app to Demos which shows how the CopyOp
	  have be
	  subclassed to create users own specific handling of copying.
	  
	  Have fixed copy constructor problems in GeoSet which fix the deep
	  copy
	  problem experienced yesterday.

2002-01-28 21:49  robert

	* A couple of fixes to DeepCopy Cloner.

2002-01-28 21:17  robert

	* Added support for shallow and deep copy of nodes, drawables and
	  state, via a
	  copy constructor which takes an optional Cloner object, and the
	  old
	  osg::Object::clone() has changed so that it now requires a Cloner
	  as paramter.
	  This is passed on to the copy constructor to help control the
	  shallow vs
	  deep copying. The old functionality of clone() which was clone of
	  type has
	  been renamed to cloneType().
	  
	  Updated all of the OSG to work with these new conventions,
	  implemention all
	  the required copy constructors etc. A couple of areas will do
	  shallow
	  copies by design, a couple of other still need to be updated to
	  do either
	  shallow or deep.
	  
	  Neither of the shallow or deep copy operations have been tested
	  yet, only
	  the old functionality of the OSG has been checked so far, such
	  running the
	  viewer on various demo datasets.
	  
	  Also fixed a problem in
	  osg::Optimize::RemoveRendundentNodesVisitor which
	  was not checking that Group didn't have have any attached
	  StateSet's, Callbacks
	  or UserData. These checks have now been added, which fixes a bug
	  which was
	  revealled by the new osgscribe demo, this related to removal of
	  group acting
	  as state decorator.
	  
	  method

2002-01-27 20:28  robert

	* Added
	  stateset->setMode(GL_LIGHTING,osg::StateAttribute::OVERRIDE_ON);
	  to scribbed
	  subgraph so that lighting is always on, this is needed since
	  glMaterial is only
	  active when lighting is enabled.

2002-01-26 20:03  robert

	* Added VisualStudio workspace files for new osgscribe demo.

2002-01-26 19:48  robert

	* Added new osgscribe demo which demostrates how to create a
	  wireframe
	  overlay of a model.

2002-01-26 14:13  robert

	* Fixed the LOD center and range code that so that the values are
	  now multiple
	  by the _unitScale to compenstate for different scales in the flt
	  model. This
	  _unitScale had already been applied to the geometry data.
	  
	  Integrated new defaults for the texturing wrap mode, for when now
	  .attr file
	  is supplied with a flt file.

2002-01-23 22:15  robert

	* Have made osg::Transform more extensible via additions of new
	  getLocalToWorldMatrix()
	  and getWorldToLocalMatrix(), computeLocalToWorld() and
	  computeWorldToLocal()
	  methods.
	  
	  Have updated the CullVisitor, IntersectVisitor and Optimizer to
	  use the
	  new osg::Transform::getLocalToWorldMatrix() which has the same
	  functionality
	  as the old getMatrix() but is now supports subclasses of
	  osg::Transform
	  transparently.
	  
	  Have added osg::PositionAttitudeTransform as subclass of
	  osg::Transform
	  which manages the transform as position and attitude via a Vec3
	  and Quat
	  respectively.

2002-01-23 15:42  robert

	* Updates to osg::Transform to allow it subclassed more easily.

2002-01-23 15:28  robert

	* Fixed problem with Optimzer::removeRedundentNodesVisitor which
	  was removing the
	  correct redundent groups but for groups which had a single child
	  it was
	  was not using replaceChild to rettach the child to its parents.
	  It was using
	  parent->removeChild(group)...parent->addChild(child); which was
	  allow the child
	  to be attached in a different place than the original group, this
	  broke LOD code.
	  Have used removeChild instead which solves the LOD problem.

2002-01-23 12:04  robert

	* Changed the ordering of applying OpenGL modes and attributes back
	  to the original
	  modes first then attributes since the it was cause a display bug
	  on some
	  datesets. It seems that the modes needs enabling before
	  glMaterial's
	  take affect, at least on the NVidia drivers under Windows and
	  Linux.
	  The OpenGL reference guide doesn't mention any dependancy so I'm
	  not
	  sure what the official line is. Some other OpenGl attribute and
	  modes
	  need to be applied in that order according to the blue book,
	  however,
	  drivers, at least the NVidia drivers seem require the opposite.
	  This may raise
	  the spectra of before and after mode applies, but this will
	  require extra
	  support in osg::State and osg::StateAttribute, and would have to
	  be handled
	  on a per attribute basis, and possibly different of each
	  platform. Yuck.

2002-01-22 19:30  robert

	* Fixed FlattenStaticTransformVisitor bug which related to
	  incorrect handling
	  of objects which were transformed by multiple matrices at one
	  time - this
	  cannot be handled in the flattening process (since we only have
	  one piece
	  of geometry to transform). This visitor now handles this case by
	  disabling
	  flattening of any objects and transforms associated in this way.

2002-01-22 12:03  robert

	* Temporily commented out the call to the
	  FlatternStaticTransformVisitor to
	  prevent a bug in handling instance nodes. Will be commented back
	  in once the
	  bug has been solved.

2002-01-22 11:03  robert

	* Updated AUTHORS file to reflect recent submission.

2002-01-22 11:03  robert

	* Added support for node instances to Open Flight loader. Submitted
	  by Yefei He.

2002-01-20 19:30  robert

	* Fixes to Windows compile.

2002-01-20 16:24  robert

	* Updates to help compilation under gcc 3.03.

2002-01-19 22:11  robert

	* Converted osgUtil::GUIEventAdapter::MouseButtonMask from
	  LEFT_BUTTON etc to
	  LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON etc, to prevent classes with #define of
	  LEFT_BUTTON.. when
	  including certain MS Windows headers. Arhsh Snarfff..

2002-01-19 20:34  robert

	* Fixed the handling of non transparent billboards, since it was
	  not taking into
	  account any accumulated transforms inherited from above.

2002-01-18 22:36  robert

	* UPdates to CullVisitor so that it keeps in sync with the new
	  method paramter
	  change in osg::Billboard.
	  
	  Removed in instance of an object being passed () brackets, have
	  removed the
	  brackets to avoid an amiguity with the compiler intepreting it as
	  a function.

2002-01-18 22:34  robert

	* Changes to fix compilation problems on the Sparc.
	  
	  GeoSet.cpp simply remove rendundent code that had already been
	  commented out.

2002-01-18 22:25  robert

	* Added support for multiple graphics contexts, submission from Max
	  Rhiener.
	  
	  Alas changed the indenting to use 4 spaces instead of tabs, this
	  irons out
	  differences when working under Windows and Unix, keeping the
	  identing
	  consistent.

2002-01-18 22:15  robert

	* First steps to updating the calcTransform function in Billboard
	  to fix
	  z axis contraint on rotation axis.

2002-01-18 19:00  robert

	* Fixed copy constructor which was copying a matrix to unitialized
	  memory.

2002-01-18 14:12  robert

	* Removed the global scope operators for the isnan(..) etc calls to
	  fix compilation
	  under some compiler combinations.

2002-01-18 14:11  robert

	* Made the osg::Timer::tick() method a const method.

2002-01-18 10:26  robert

	* Fixed typo in comment, reference to BoundingSphere has been
	  changed to
	  BoundingBox. Typo spotted by Gial Paolo Lorenzetto.

2002-01-17 22:41  robert

	* Fixed ENALBE_ALL_CULLING spelling mistake, have changed it to
	  ENABLE_ALL_CULLING.

2002-01-17 22:40  robert

	* Added support for glutSpecialFunc, glutSpaceballMotion,
	  glutSpaceballRotate and
	  glutSpaceballRotate into osgGLUT::Window base class.

2002-01-16 21:23  robert

	* Reversed the ordering of setting of OpenGL modes and attributes,
	  so that
	  attributes are now set first, then modes. This is keep consistent
	  with
	  the setting of glColorMaterial and glEnable(GL_COLOR_MATERIAL) as
	  specfied
	  in OpenGL documentation.

2002-01-16 21:22  robert

	* Changed the enum Types { ... } so that in no longer explicitly
	  sets the values,
	  leaving C++ to ensire that values are unque and insequence.

2002-01-16 21:20  robert

	* Fixes to makefiles which have become a bit unhinged after MacOS X
	  integration.

2002-01-16 21:12  robert

	* Added support for billboard in OpenFlight loader. Submission from
	  Nikolaus Hanekamp.

2002-01-16 12:29  robert

	* Submission from Sean Spicer which adds Make/makedefs.irix.std.64
	  which
	  compiles the OSG as 64bit. Small changes by Robert to accomodate
	  recent MacOSX makefile changes.

2002-01-16 12:08  robert

	* Changes to Make/makerules.* and Make/makedefs.* to accomodate
	  MacOSX's need
	  to treat plugins and shared libraries seperately.

2002-01-16 12:05  robert

	* Integrated the changes to osgPlugin/Makefile's for MacOSX port.

2002-01-16 12:03  robert

	* Changed hardwired char[1024] arrays to
	  char[FILEUTILS_MAX_PATH_LENGTH] and
	  defined the value to be 2048, this should avoid problems with
	  path lengths
	  which have been overflowing the 1024 limit (Sasa report this
	  bug). The
	  real solution is to use std::string throught FileUtils, but this
	  will have
	  to wait for another day.

2002-01-16 10:41  robert

	* Added quicktime plugin (for Mac's only), submitted by Phil Atkin.

2002-01-16 10:36  robert

	* First batch of changes required for MacOS X build. Orignal
	  submission from
	  Phil Atkin, merged by Robert Osfield.

2002-01-15 23:21  robert

	* Changed the use of std::vector<..>.begin() to &vector<..>.front()
	  in code
	  from passing the vector contents to the
	  GeoSet::setPrimLengths(..) etc.
	  methods. This has been done to fix the compile under the MS .NET
	  compiler
	  which has changed the definiation of the
	  std::vector<..>::iterator to
	  a class rather than a pointer.

2002-01-15 19:54  robert

	* Fix to osgDB::getStrippedName(..) so that handles the case of
	  file without
	  an extension.

2002-01-15 15:49  robert

	* Added '# LIBS += -limage' and explanation in comments to pfb
	  Makefile,
	  submitted by Randall Hooper.

2002-01-15 12:13  robert

	* Added the set of GL_TEXTURE_GEN_S and _T to code converting
	  pfTexGen to
	  osg::TexGen. This is try and fix a bug in handling tex gen
	  datasets such
	  as sj_texgen.pfb.

2002-01-15 11:05  robert

	* New ajustAspectRatio (ADJUST_NODE) mode added to osg::Camera to
	  fix issue
	  with integration with vrjuggler, submitted by Allen Bierbaum.

2002-01-12 21:49  robert

	* Missing _attachedTransformMode in osg::Camera constructor, fix
	  submitted by
	  Ben Discoe.

2002-01-05 16:19  robert

	* Change TOP to OSGHOME in makefiles.

2002-01-05 16:18  robert

	* Moved the setting of camera fusion distance mode into the handle
	  method so that
	  it is updated on everyframe to ensure that switching between
	  Drive/Flight
	  and Trackball happens seemlessly.

2002-01-04 20:44  robert

	* Renamed the TOP variable in the Makefiles to OSGHOME.

2002-01-04 20:43  robert

	* Added a guard to osg::LOD::evaluate so that it returns -1 if the
	  range
	  matched does not have a corresponding child to relate to. This
	  can happen
	  if a user creates more than n+1 ranges, where n is the number of
	  LOD children.

2002-01-04 17:35  robert

	* Added osg::ShadeModel state attribute which encapsulates
	  glShadeModel.

2002-01-04 17:34  robert

	* Fixed a bug in writing of line strips and line loops to the .osg
	  file.

2002-01-04 13:14  robert

	* Fixed multiple deletion of shared indecies in GeoSet destructor.

2002-01-03 23:28  robert

	* Futher Makefile updates for Cygwin support - from Norman Vine.

2002-01-03 23:19  robert

	* Makefile changes to support Cywin port - submission from Norman
	  Vine, updates
	  to fix case problems under unix by Robert.

2002-01-03 21:34  robert

	* Updates for Cygwin port, from Norman Vine.

2002-01-03 19:28  robert

	* Small source code changes for Cygwin port of OSG.

2002-01-02 17:01  robert

	* Updates in preperation for the third attempt at the 0.8.43
	  release.

2002-01-02 15:42  robert

	* Updates from Randall Hopper to fix build under IRIX.

2002-01-02 11:03  robert

	* A small bug fix to the matrix dump function (it was primtiing out
	  5 columns
	  instead of four).
	  
	  Added support for multiplying mesh geometry by the matrix
	  attached to the
	  Lib3dsMesh structure, however this produces disjointed models so
	  have
	  to the default mode to bypass this multiplication code. Will need
	  to revisit
	  this in the future.

2002-01-02 10:59  robert

	* Commented out the smoothing of FLAT_TRIANGLE_STRIP and
	  FLAT_TRIANGLE_FAN
	  since it was causes problems with any color list which were
	  attached.

2002-01-02 10:53  robert

	* Moved the glShadeModel(FLAT/SMOOTH) outside of the primtitive
	  inner loop to reduce
	  the amount state changes incurred when using FLAT_ primtives.

2002-01-02 10:49  robert

	* Fixed the orientation of for_each_triangle cases for QUAD and
	  QUAD_STRIP.

2001-12-31 23:21  robert

	* Removed the variables which were duplicated in osgGLUT::Viewer
	  and
	  osgGLUT::Window, standardising on the Window ones, and therefore
	  removing
	  an unitialized variable that had been introduced. This caused a
	  crash
	  under WindowsXP due to send invalid values to glutReshapeWindow.

2001-12-31 23:16  robert

	* Added a more detailed explanation of how LOD's work.

2001-12-31 00:04  robert

	* Updates to NEWS for date of release, and added
	  include/osg/DisplaySettings
	  and include/osg/LineWidth to the src/osg/Makefile.

2001-12-30 20:48  robert

	* Final update of ChangeLog for the 0.8.43 release.

2001-12-30 20:03  robert

	* Added osg::GeoSet::FLAT_TRIANGLE_FAN to the list if primitive
	  handled by the
	  for_each_triangle template function.

2001-12-30 19:04  robert

	* Added /usr/local/lib to the s_default_dso_path search path for
	  plugins.

2001-12-30 17:13  robert

	* Made the output message related to not registering a camera
	  manipulator
	  with the GLUT Viewer output as INFO rather than as a NOTICE. This
	  suppress
	  this message which was appearing on some of the demos all the
	  time, even
	  though are quite reasonable default behaviour is used.

2001-12-30 16:59  robert

	* Added references to sgv -stereo and sgv -stencil to the notes of
	  running
	  the demos.

2001-12-30 16:58  robert

	* Updated the default home position of so that a better view of the
	  scene is seen.

2001-12-30 15:24  robert

	* Moved the old by hand ChangeLog to ChangeLog.preCVS and then ran
	  cvs2cl.pl
	  to automatically generate the new ChangeLog.

2001-12-30 15:12  robert

	* Did a make docs, in preperation for 0.8.43 release.

2001-12-30 15:01  robert

	* Compilation fix to pfb plugin, sent in by Ulrich Hertlein.

2001-12-30 15:00  robert

	* Added a comment in Windows section on INSTALL notes such that it
	  now
	  recommends that you build all the libs.

2001-12-29 20:53  robert

	* Added .README to prevent CVS from deleting the empty bin
	  directory when checking
	  out copies. This was a problem with the nightly tarballs.

2001-12-29 14:27  robert

	* Added comment to osg::Transform w.r.t use of GL_NORMALIZE when
	  using
	  scaling Transforms.

2001-12-29 12:28  robert

	* Updates form Randall Hopper for the FreeBSD build

2001-12-27 20:06  robert

	* Made inline documentation on the Values enum clearer w.r.t the
	  function of
	  OVERRIDE_ON and OVERRIDE_OFF.

2001-12-26 20:55  robert

	* Added more details about using stereo with the OSG, in particular
	  the
	  role of the camera manipulators and the fusion distance.

2001-12-24 23:34  robert

	* Updated doc++ references so that CVS knows about all the newly
	  generated
	  files.

2001-12-24 23:28  robert

	* Updated the index.html to include references to the new osgText
	  library and
	  demo app.

2001-12-24 23:14  robert

	* Removed references to redundent environmental variables.

2001-12-24 21:56  robert

	* Did a make docs.

2001-12-24 21:34  robert

	* Fixed the osg::Light so that it requires the user to explicitly
	  define which
	  OpenGL light is being operated on, and also now relies upong the
	  standard
	  osg::State handling of OpenGL modes to switch on the appropriate
	  lights.
	  
	  The previous static counter mechansim for the light number was
	  causing a
	  redundent light to be created when the osg plugin created the
	  first osg::Light
	  to use a prototype for other osg::Light's to be cloned from in
	  the
	  .osg plugin execution.
	  
	  The static count mechanism also prevent the lights modes being
	  controlled
	  independantly from the setting of the light paramters themselves.
	  This
	  meant that a light once created was global, and couldn't be
	  turned off
	  locally via the OSG's support for OpenGL mode enabling/disabling.
	  This
	  has been overcome with the new implementation, the user has
	  complete
	  flexiblity of when and where to use the different lights at their
	  disposal.

2001-12-24 19:06  robert

	* Updated the osgGLUT::Viewer to subclass from osgGLUT::Window as
	  has been
	  intended since the development of osgGLUT::Window.

2001-12-24 15:12  robert

	* updates for windows build

2001-12-24 14:12  robert

	* Various clean ups for the release.

2001-12-22 22:30  robert

	* Updates to keep things compiling under Windows. Also cleaned up
	  the new stereo.html docs.

2001-12-22 21:35  robert

	* Added beginnings on documentation for stereo support, the
	  stereo.html needs
	  to be re-edited in a html editor before it becomes readable
	  though..

2001-12-22 14:55  robert

	* Updated usage messages to include new stereo and stencil
	  commandline options.

2001-12-21 22:48  robert

	* Further work on improving stereo support in the OSG.
	  
	  Renamed the osg::VisualsSettings to osg::DisplaySettings, and
	  osgUtil::VisualsRequirementsVisitor to
	  osgUtil::DisplayRequirementsVisitor.
	  
	  Added support for OSG_SCREEN_HEIGHT into osg::DisplaySettings,
	  and added
	  a DisplaySettings* to the constructors of osg::SceneView and
	  osg::Camera.

2001-12-21 13:07  robert

	* Updates to the support for stereo in osg::Camera,
	  osgUtil::SceneView and
	  the CameraManipulators.

2001-12-20 20:48  robert

	* Added support for glLineWidth via an osg::LineWidth
	  StateAttribute.

2001-12-20 16:35  robert

	* Updates to the camera code related to stereo, adding fusion
	  distance.

2001-12-20 16:34  robert

	* Added check for null models be returned form
	  osgDB::readNodeFiles(..) to
	  prevent execution when no models have been loaded.

2001-12-20 12:12  robert

	* Updates to flt loading of light points, from Brede Johansen.

2001-12-19 15:20  robert

	* Updates to Stereo code.

2001-12-19 10:29  robert

	* Updated the demos to support the new commandline handling of
	  stereo and
	  convinience functios for loading libs and files.

2001-12-19 08:49  robert

	* Added check for GL_ARB_imaging extension to osg;:ColorMatrix

2001-12-19 01:10  robert

	* Compilation fixes under for Windows

2001-12-19 00:38  robert

	* Adding support for controlling visual settings via environmental
	  variables
	  and command line paramters. Including support for stereo and
	  stencil buffer.

2001-12-18 11:28  robert

	* Added range checking to osg::Camera::adjustAspectRatio to catch
	  invalid values being
	  passed to Camera. Invalid values were occuring when iconising the
	  Windows GLUT
	  based OSG demos.

2001-12-18 10:46  robert

	* Fixed compilation problems in flt plugin under Windows, and
	  removed usage of
	  the default GeoSet::AtttributeDeleteFunctor from the DynGeoSet
	  since it handled
	  the memory deletion iteself via STL containers.

2001-12-17 21:13  robert

	* Changed the default field of Y to 45 degrees, as this is probably
	  a better
	  default than 30 degrees (what it was temproarily) or the 90
	  degrees that
	  it was originally.

2001-12-17 17:34  don

	* Fixed IRIX compile issues with the flt loader.
	  
	  ReaderWriterATTR.cpp had a variable "mips" defined, which is
	  predefined for the IRIX preprocessor.
	  Changed this to _mips.
	  
	  FltFile.cpp had a class and transient variable defined within the
	  scope of member function
	  FltFile::readExternals(), which was causing the IRIX 7.3 compiles
	  to hork. Moved the class
	  definition to outside of the member function scope.

2001-12-17 16:21  don

	* Fixed IRIX build. Required some namespace fixes and include and
	  link
	  directives in the Makefiles

2001-12-17 15:05  robert

	* Updated the Optimzer::FatternStaticTransform visit so by default
	  it ignores
	  all dynamic transforms, previously it flattened dynamic
	  transforms as well.

2001-12-17 09:29  robert

	* Added std:: infront of endl to ensure compilation under Windows.

2001-12-16 22:20  robert

	* Integrated detailed near clipping plane calculation into
	  osgUtil::CullVisitor,
	  submitted by Sasa Bistroviae.

2001-12-16 16:30  robert

	* From John Davis, a little addition to the Windows version of the
	  osg::Timer
	  constructor such that a static variable is used to force the
	  constructor
	  to check the number of clock cycles per second once, this means
	  that
	  multiple timers can now be created with incurring a the 1 second
	  delay
	  used for timming the clock speed every time the constructor is
	  called.

2001-12-15 22:44  robert

	* Updated version numbers to 0.8.43 in prep for the impending
	  release.

2001-12-15 22:41  robert

	* Added comments on how to set up STLport under Windows and IRIX.

2001-12-15 16:56  robert

	* Renamed osg::Matric::makeIdent() to osg::Matrix::makeIdentity()
	  to make
	  it consistent with the rest of the osg::Matrix naming. Updated
	  OSG
	  distribution to account for new name.
	  
	  Added support for the STATIC/DYNAMIC osg::Transform::Type to the
	  .osg
	  ASCII reader/writer plugin and the flt reader plugin.
	  
	  Removed the non cost version of osg::Transform::getMatrix() as
	  this could
	  by pass the dirty mechinism.

2001-12-15 10:00  robert

	* updates for windows build.

2001-12-14 23:18  robert

	* Fixes to Windows build in liu of the move to using just
	  std::streams.

2001-12-14 21:49  robert

	* Updated OSG so that the old OSG_USE_IO_DOT_H has be removed from
	  all headers
	  that used it, all references to the Standard C++ stream classes
	  use the
	  std::ostream etc convention, all references to "using namespace
	  std" and
	  "using namespace std::ostream etc" have been removed.

2001-12-14 18:06  robert

	* Updatedwidley used includes to remove most of the float/double
	  warnings
	  generated when compiling under Windows with STLport.

2001-12-14 16:15  robert

	* Don haved accidentally removed the reference to osg.dsp from the
	  .dsw file,
	  breakin the Windows build.

2001-12-14 15:37  don

	* Removed ^M from Makefile

2001-12-14 15:16  don

	* Appeased poor MS VisualStudio by adding the ^M's to all .dsw and
	  .dsp files.

2001-12-14 15:10  don

	* Fixed newline/cr problem

2001-12-14 14:25  robert

	* Fixed problem with incorrect combining of some LOD's derived from
	  flt databases.
	  Problem related to the order of the removal of redudent groups
	  and LOD combining,
	  the LOD combining only working properly if done first.

2001-12-14 10:47  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 build related to changes in using namespace std.

2001-12-14 10:02  robert

	* Removed all references to using namespace std to help solve
	  compilation problems
	  under Windows and IRIX.
	  
	  Also integrated small change to lib3ds from Drew for IRIX
	  compilation.

2001-12-12 20:29  robert

	* Made the following name changes to Matrix and Quat to clean them
	  up and make
	  the functionality clear given the name. This will break user code
	  unfortunately
	  so please be away of the following mapping.
	  
	  osg::Matrix::makeTrans(..)?\026 -> osg::Matrix::makeTranslate(..)
	  osg::Matrix::makeRot(..)?\026 -> osg::Matrix::makeRotate(..)
	  osg::Matrix::trans(..)?\026 -> osg::Matrix::translate(..)
	  
	  osg::Quat::makeRot(..)?\026 -> osg::Quat::makeRotate(..)
	  
	  Also updated the rest of the OSG distribution to use the new
	  names, and
	  have removed the old deprecated Matrix methods too.

2001-12-12 15:09  robert

	* Fixed problems with osg::Matrix::makeRot(from,to) and
	  osg::Quat::makeRot(from,to)
	  so that they both use the same implementation (the Quat code now)
	  and the
	  code has been corrected to work from and to vectors which
	  directly opposite
	  to one another.

2001-12-12 12:55  robert

	* Fixed problem with loading interleaved arrays in the .osg loader,
	  and corrected
	  a spelling mistake in osg::GeoSet.

2001-12-12 05:09  don

	* Added translation and scaling to osgconv

2001-12-11 17:00  don

	* Fixed Matrix::rotate( Vec3 from, Vec3 to); was using to X from to
	  derive
	  axis, which causes a left-handed rotation. Fixed to from X to.

2001-12-11 16:00  robert

	* Fixed compilation problems under Windows due to changes in using
	  std::ostream etc.

2001-12-11 11:22  robert

	* Removed the 'using namespace std' and replaced with more specific
	  'using std::ostream'
	  this should help prevent polution of the global namespace with
	  std when including
	  these osg include files.

2001-12-11 11:21  robert

	* Added :Referenced() to the osg::Camera(..) copy constructor to
	  prevent a warning
	  under Linux.

2001-12-09 03:46  don

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-12-04 22:57  robert

	* Added support for automatic deletion of osg::GeoSet's attributes,
	  via a
	  default AttributeDeleteFunctor which uses delete []. Users can
	  create
	  their own handlers for the attribute memory to override this
	  default
	  behavior.
	  
	  Fixed a typo in ReaderWriterOBJ.cpp.

2001-12-04 20:38  robert

	* Various files which should have been checked in earlier but were
	  missed...
	  VisualStudio files for flt loader, and header files or Image and
	  Texture
	  for new osg::Texture::CLAMP_TO_EDGE and osg::Image::dirty.

2001-12-04 19:41  robert

	* Updates to the flt loader, from Brede Johansen.

2001-12-04 16:03  robert

	* Integrated Brede Johansen's updates to flt loader.

2001-12-04 15:56  robert

	* Made a output message output as osg::DEBUG only.

2001-12-04 12:34  robert

	* Commented out the code to force sgv to use ANAGLYPHIC_STEREO as
	  this should
	  not be the default, will add options to do this later.

2001-12-04 12:31  robert

	* Improved support for anaglyphic stereo.
	  
	  Integrated texture CLAMP_TO_EDGE, submitted by Ulrich Hertlein.

2001-12-02 22:20  robert

	* Beginings of support for quad bufferd, red/green, and slit screen
	  stereo.

2001-12-02 08:59  don

	* Corrected a small booboo in preprocessor guard for header file in
	  GLU and
	  added Matrix::identity() to Matrix

2001-11-30 20:53  robert

	* Fixed bug in osg::StateSet::merge(..) where the containers were
	  being
	  iterated from begin() to begin() rather than begin() to end().

2001-11-21 15:53  don

	* Small fix for preprocessor _MP symbol clash with MFC.

2001-11-19 13:14  robert

	* Made the Warning font file not found message consistent with
	  other file not
	  found messages.

2001-11-19 11:52  robert

	* Added DLL export to the internal classes in osgUtil::Optimize so
	  that the internal
	  classes can be used directly by client applications.

2001-11-19 10:40  robert

	* Added warning report for when a font file cannot be found.

2001-11-18 21:31  robert

	* Added osg::Image::dirtyImage() and setModifiedTag() to allow
	  external
	  updating of the image modified flag to be used in conjunction
	  with
	  texture subloading.

2001-11-15 11:59  robert

	* Move the call to the manipulators before the scene app traversal
	  to that
	  any changes to the scene graph, such as adding an app callback
	  can be
	  seen by during the same frame.

2001-11-14 15:53  robert

	* Fixes for windows compilation

2001-11-14 15:52  robert

	* Fixed compilation problem under Wndows

2001-11-14 15:32  robert

	* Fixed compilation problem under Wndows

2001-11-14 14:10  robert

	* Added osgUtil::TransformCallback to help with rigid body
	  animation.

2001-11-14 14:09  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build.
	  
	  Updates to the osg::Transform, adding preMult and postMult
	  methods and
	  deprecating the old preRotate,preTranslate,preScale.
	  
	  Updated the rest of the OSG so that it nolonger uses the
	  deprecated
	  osg::Transform nodes.
	  
	  Renamed osgUtil::SceneView::setGlobalState() to
	  osgUtil::SceneView::setGlobalStateSet() so that the name reflects
	  its
	  functionality better. Updated osgGLUT::Viewer etc to cope with
	  new
	  name change.

2001-11-12 10:04  robert

	* Added new files to cvs.

2001-11-12 10:00  robert

	* Added src/osg/NodeCallback.cpp.

2001-11-11 22:32  robert

	* Fixed compilation error in src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp.
	  
	  Added support for nested NodeCallbacks, allowing them to be
	  chained together
	  so that multiple operations can be applied.

2001-11-10 15:46  robert

	* Fixed osgUtil::Optimizer::FlatternStaticTransformsVisitor so that
	  the
	  apply(osg::LOD) scaled the ranges in addition to transform the
	  center
	  point and children.

2001-11-10 13:36  robert

	* Fixed bug related to
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlatternStaticTransform::Visitor's
	  apply(Billboard& ) method which was apply the accumulated
	  transform to
	  the billbaord geometry when it should have been applying the
	  matrix without
	  the transform component.

2001-11-09 15:06  robert

	* Added osgText::Paragraph which is a subclass from Geode which
	  composes a
	  list of text drawables as a paragraph block, handles breaking of
	  text into
	  individual lines automatically.
	  
	  Changed the osg::Node::setUserData so that the data type has to
	  be an
	  osg::Referenced, and removes the dependancy on
	  osg::MemoryAdapter. I have
	  done this since it simplifies the OSG side of the interface and
	  makes it
	  less like that the user might abuse the memory managment of the
	  data. It
	  does however mean that user data will have by subclassed from
	  Referenced,
	  and therefor may require users to have their own adapter to do
	  this.
	  However, this little nuasance is worth the extra cleaness and
	  robustness
	  afforded by going the osg::Referenced route.

2001-11-09 15:01  robert

	* Fixed the findFileFile routine which had been broken by a fix of
	  a dlopen
	  problem - './' was added to all files which which directly found
	  without
	  requiring a search path rather than just locally found files,
	  this broke
	  file loads which had wern't local but had a valid path. I have
	  moved the
	  './' work around to inside fileDSO and made it only apply to
	  Linux as I
	  presume this is all it was needed for. Don?

2001-11-08 13:50  robert

	* Fixed the IntersectVisitor which was broken by a recent patch to
	  catch parallel
	  line and traingle combinations.

2001-11-07 12:42  robert

	* Added a dirtyBound() to osgUtil::Optimizer.
	  Corrected mispelling of alignment is osg::Text and the osgtext
	  demo.
	  Added guards for divide bu zero's to osg::IntersectVisitor.

2001-11-06 11:36  robert

	* Fixed inlcude/BoundingBox to compile under Windows.

2001-11-06 11:07  robert

	* Fixed inlcude/Math to compile under Windows.

2001-11-06 10:34  robert

	* Added methods to support isNaN,isInfinte and valid to osg::Vec*
	  and osg::Math,
	  and added a guard to IntersectVisitor which uses these new
	  methods to prevent
	  invalid segments being added.

2001-11-04 19:29  robert

	* Integrated updates to stats sent in my Geoff Michel.

2001-11-02 21:20  don

	* Fixed findFileInPath to prepend ./ if file is in local directory.
	  This was
	  needed by dlopen() for dso's in the current directory

2001-11-02 20:11  robert

	* Updates to Makefiles to include osgText.
	  Also a couple of undefined methods in osgText::Text have been
	  added.

2001-11-02 12:26  robert

	* Updated index.html with dependacy info about the new osgText
	  library.
	  Modified osg/Drawable::draw(..) so that it uses display list
	  COMPILE
	  rather than COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE to solve performance problems
	  under
	  NVidia drivers. The old behavior is still available by comments
	  out
	  a #define.
	  Fixed the default compilation list src/osgPlugins/Makefile so
	  that it
	  compiles by defalt png and gif.

2001-11-01 16:35  robert

	* Updates to the flt loader from Brede Johansen.

2001-11-01 15:13  robert

	* Updates to osgText to fix a crash on ikart.tff font available
	  under Linux, the
	  bug was related to texel padding of the height not be accounted
	  for in texture
	  size calculation, but was used during populating the image data
	  causing a
	  mismatch.

2001-10-31 22:35  robert

	* Added missing config.h file to src/osgPlugins/lib3ds.

2001-10-31 20:04  robert

	* Added a bool paramter to osg::StateSet::compare(const StateSet&
	  rhs,bool compareAttributeContents=false) const;
	  to allow it to use different comparison schemes, now it can use
	  checking for pointer equality (the default)
	  or attribute contexts. This has been added to assist optimization
	  of databases within the flt loader, but
	  also could be useful for other operations too.

2001-10-31 18:33  robert

	* Updated the lib3ds plugin with the new 1.1 version of lib3ds.

2001-10-31 12:27  robert

	* Update to osgText to get things compiling under Windows.

2001-10-31 11:41  robert

	* Update osgText.dsp to define FTGL_STATICLIBRARY to prevent it
	  compiling
	  the as a seperate library and producing linkage warnings.

2001-10-31 10:20  robert

	* Updated the FTGL implemention in osgText to FTFL1.1.

2001-10-30 19:23  robert

	* Further updates to the ReaderWriter support in osgDB, and a fix
	  to a small warning
	  in Matrix.cpp.

2001-10-30 14:20  robert

	* Added support for ReadResult and WriteResult to the
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter
	  to allo plugins to pass back more information about the success
	  or failure
	  of a file load. All plugins have been updated to the new
	  convention.

2001-10-29 19:29  robert

	* Changed a #define ... (GLenum) 0x84fe to 0x84FE to fix problems
	  under MacOS9
	  build.

2001-10-29 12:22  robert

	* Ran to_unix over src/Demos/osgtext/main.cpp to try and fix some
	  return type
	  problems reported under Windows.

2001-10-29 12:19  robert

	* Added missing src/osgText/Version.cpp file.

2001-10-25 01:11  bryan

	* Imposter.cpp added to the project

2001-10-25 00:49  bryan

	* Changed the int to a GLint because of the differences within
	  mac/win32/linux versions of gl.h.

2001-10-25 00:45  bryan

	* sgv is almost working

2001-10-24 23:15  robert

	* Completed work on osgText compilation under Win32. We now
	  have fonts under Wndows and Linux :-)

2001-10-24 22:29  robert

	* Updates to the visual studio files for osgText.

2001-10-24 19:48  robert

	* Updates of osgDB/FileUtils to fix compilation problems under
	  Win32

2001-10-24 13:46  robert

	* Updates to osgText.

2001-10-24 12:53  robert

	* Updates to osgText and osgDB so that the loading of text fonts
	  can use
	  osgDB::findFile() to locate font files from the OSGFILEPATH
	  environmental
	  variable.

2001-10-24 09:41  robert

	* Updated FTGL version to 1.0 and removed a couple of warnings in
	  the osgText demo.

2001-10-24 09:08  robert

	* Updated the osgText implemention, now works under Linux.

2001-10-23 23:23  don

	* Added stat.c

2001-10-23 23:15  don

	* One last change needed to makedefs.linux to sync Linux and Irix
	  pfb loader

2001-10-23 23:10  don

	* Fixed pfb loader functionality for IRIX

2001-10-23 22:59  don

	* Fixed pfb loader so that it works for both Linux and IRix with
	  dynamic
	  libraries, and provides support to load (almost) all that
	  Performer loads.

2001-10-23 22:28  robert

	* Further work on getting osgText compiling.

2001-10-23 22:12  robert

	* Removed old .cc versions of FT font code.

2001-10-23 22:09  robert

	* Adding in new .cpp versions of FT font code.

2001-10-23 22:08  robert

	* Updates to the new osgText library to get it to compile under
	  Linux.

2001-10-23 20:04  robert

	* Converted FTGL files from mac style return to unix style.

2001-10-23 19:51  robert

	* First past integrat of Max Rhiener work on wrapping FTGL to
	  create osgText
	  library and demo.

2001-10-23 15:55  robert

	* Added new osgGLUT::Window base class which is very basic right
	  now, all it does
	  is bring up a GLUT window and provide virtual functions from
	  which users should
	  subclass to add functionality.

2001-10-22 22:02  robert

	* Integrated Geoff Michel's updates to Stats code, whilest move all
	  text rendering
	  back in the viewer from the Statistics header.
	  
	  Added a osg::State::captureCurrentState(StateSet&) method and a
	  copy constructor
	  to osg::StateSet.

2001-10-21 21:27  robert

	* Moved all #include "osg/.." references to #include <osg/..> to
	  aid port to
	  MacOS.

2001-10-20 20:26  robert

	* Added support for an osgUtil::SceneView::init() traversal which
	  is called once
	  per scene view. The user can attach a NodeVisitor to do init for
	  them, or
	  leave it to the default which is to use the
	  osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor
	  which compiles all display lists and texture objects. The init
	  traversal
	  is called automatically by the first call to either app() or
	  cull(), so
	  should not be called by user code during initialization. This
	  ensures
	  that a valid graphics context has been established before OpenGL
	  is initialized.
	  
	  osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor has also been updated to use a bit
	  mask for options, and the addition of
	  compilation of texture objects (via StateAttribute::compile) has
	  also been
	  added.

2001-10-20 09:48  robert

	* Added #ifdef to Performer ReaderWriterPFB so that pfdLoadFile is
	  used under
	  IRIX and pfdLoadFile_pfb is used under Linux.

2001-10-19 15:53  robert

	* Removed Lighting.cpp from repository, it is nolonger used and was
	  just hanging
	  around erroneously.

2001-10-19 15:30  robert

	* Updated the osgUtil::Optimize so that the call to
	  Optimize::StateVisitor is
	  #ifdef out under Win32 and STL port isn't being used. This
	  prevents crashes
	  due to MS's flacky STL implementation.

2001-10-19 14:22  robert

	* Added osgUtil::Optimizer which contains four visitor each
	  designed for doing
	  different types of optimization on the scene graph - state
	  optimization,
	  flattening static transforms, combining LOD's and removing
	  redundent groups.
	  The new Optimizer replaces the once seperate
	  OptimizerStateVisitor.

2001-10-19 12:56  robert

	* Added support for specifying whether view frustum and small
	  feature culling
	  should be applied to a node or its child with the new
	  osg::Node::setCullingActive()
	  flag. A mechanism has been implemented so that if child has its
	  culling disabled
	  then their parents, all the way up to the root are also have
	  their culling
	  implicitly disabled.
	  
	  The osg::CullVisitor has updated to take account of
	  both the explicit control via setCullingActive and the implicit
	  culling
	  disabling through children being disabled.
	  
	  This feature is useful for nodes which don't have a bounding
	  volume to cull
	  against, earth sky implementations and light sources.
	  
	  The default osg::Node::_cullingActive is true, i.e. culling is
	  enabled by
	  default.

2001-10-17 22:17  don

	* Fixed static libraries in madefs.linux and error in
	  ReaderWriterPFB.cpp

2001-10-16 22:30  bryan

	* Update the tree to my version of the project file (I thought it
	  was already in)
	  - Hang glide demo works
	  - sgv is still being fixed

2001-10-16 21:47  robert

	* Reverted Bryan's changes to FrameStamp w.r.t std::tm structure
	  which doesn't
	  compile under Win32 and IRIX. Will need to find another solution.

2001-10-16 21:32  bryan

	* This was the old project file. It's no longer used.

2001-10-16 20:56  bryan

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-10-16 18:39  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build - submitted by Randall Hopper.

2001-10-16 16:48  robert

	* Fixes for Win32 compilation.

2001-10-16 15:03  robert

	* Fixed then normal smoothing function in the .3ds loader and the
	  osgUtil::SmoothingVisitor so that unused normals at left at 0,0,0
	  insead
	  of being normalized, which results in (nan,nan,nan).

2001-10-16 14:24  robert

	* Completed implementation of a the new CombineLODsVisitor, ideal
	  for use with
	  the .flt loader. Code is stuff currently in sgv, but will be
	  moved out once
	  more testing has been done.

2001-10-16 10:04  robert

	* Added support for transforming LOD and Billboard centers to the
	  OrientationConverter and the flattenTransformVisitor in sgv.

2001-10-16 10:03  robert

	* Modified Veiewer.cpp so that when toggling the light with 'l' the
	  light can
	  be overrided to off and overrided to on, previoulsy it only
	  overrided to off.

2001-10-16 08:24  robert

	* Fixed problem caused by ReaderWriterPFB::writeNode(..) not
	  ensuring that the
	  file extension was .pfb. Have added a check.

2001-10-16 03:59  don

	* added float *() operator to Vec{2,3,4} so we can pass Vec3's
	  directly to
	  OpenGL glVertex?fv().

2001-10-15 15:50  robert

	* Fixes for compilation under IRIX, submitted by Randal Hopper,
	  with mods
	  from Robert.

2001-10-15 14:29  robert

	* Made the new global state attribute instances in osg::State use
	  osg:ref_ptr
	  to automatically handle the memory deletion.

2001-10-15 14:07  robert

	* Added support for automatic creation of global StateAttributes to
	  osg::State,
	  these global attributes are created by cloning any attributes
	  which are
	  applied during rendering, the clone in a shallow copy, which will
	  set up
	  default valus for that attribute. This should prevent attribute
	  bleed
	  from one stateset to the next when the global StateSet doesn't
	  contain
	  an attribute used within the scene graph.

2001-10-15 11:18  robert

	* Fixed rotations to account to the fixes made to Quat and Matrix
	  related to
	  right hand rule rotation.

2001-10-15 08:40  robert

	* The writeImage/Object/Node methods in the .osg and .pfb
	  reader/writer didn't
	  have the new ReaderWriter::Options* structure passed to them,
	  which meant the
	  the virtual functions didn't bind with the new base class methods
	  and wern't
	  called on a write.

2001-10-15 03:32  don

	* Updated pfb loader to load pfb files into osg. Still broken for
	  loading osg
	  files into Performer, however.

2001-10-14 17:54  robert

	* Added osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options class to the ReaderWriter base
	  class, support
	  for settings options in osgDB::Registry, and added the paramter
	  to all of the
	  reaader/writer plugins. The Options structure by default has an
	  string attached
	  for packing basic options, however, it also can be subclassed to
	  encapsulate
	  any users defined option data. In the later case both the client
	  code *and*
	  the plugin need to be aware of subclass, the plugin will need to
	  use
	  dynamic_cast<> to assertain its type.

2001-10-14 16:56  robert

	* Added OrientationConverter.cpp to the VisualStudio project files
	  for osgconv.

2001-10-14 16:55  robert

	* Changed the OrientationConverter.cpp's to have consitent
	  captilization as its
	  associated header file.

2001-10-14 14:23  robert

	* Fixed TransformFunctor code so that it now uses the inverse of
	  the
	  transformation matrix to transform the normal.

2001-10-14 14:23  robert

	* Fixed a bug in Matrix::invert(..) which did not set
	  full_realised=true,
	  so that one Matrices which had not previously be initialized
	  we're
	  erronously initialized later in the code resetting it to
	  identity.

2001-10-14 09:58  robert

	* Added osg::StateSet::merge(const StateSet& rhs) merges merges the
	  modes and
	  attributes of rhs into 'this' stateset.

2001-10-14 09:57  robert

	* Fixed the Flight and Drive manipulators to work with the updated
	  Matrix::rotate
	  code.

2001-10-14 06:01  don

	* Fixed a small boo-boo in definition of bit masks in
	  include/osg/Drawable
	  
	  Fixed incorrect normal conversions for osgconv.

2001-10-14 05:33  don

	* Mr. O added fancy, shmanzy C++ code, but broke normal transform
	  functionality
	  Fixed.

2001-10-14 05:14  don

	* Quick 'n dirty fix to TrackballManipulator to get the rotations
	  doing the
	  right things after the Quat fixes.

2001-10-14 04:50  don

	* Cleaned up some 'make clobber' issues in root Makefile

2001-10-14 04:28  don

	* Quaternions were assigning inverted values during conversion to
	  matricies.
	  This is probably due to an error on the gamasutra web page
	  demonstrating this.
	  It caused left-handed rotations rather than right handed
	  rotations. Should be
	  fixed now.

2001-10-13 11:16  robert

	* Changed the naming and calling convention of the new
	  Drawable::AttributeFunctor
	  and have updated GeoSet to use mutable values for the _numverts
	  etc, allowing
	  osg::GeoSet::computeNumVerts() to be a const operation.
	  osg::GeoSet::getNumVerts
	  is now a const once more, so avoiding compilation problems. Also
	  chaned the new
	  osgconv orientation code to use a Drawable::AttributeFunctor so
	  it can work on
	  other Drawables other than just GeoSets.

2001-10-13 09:48  don

	* Added Mr. Osfields dynamic_cast<> and test for validity test.

2001-10-13 08:34  don

	* backed out right-handed coordinate transform for
	  makeRot(vec3,vec3) in Quat.cpp

2001-10-13 08:32  don

	* A few more clean ups

2001-10-13 07:41  don

	* Cleaned up the usage message

2001-10-13 07:24  don

	* Updated osgconv to be able to handle orientation swapping.

2001-10-13 06:23  don

	* Changed some routines to produce right-handed rotations.

2001-10-13 06:22  don

	* checking files in to move development location

2001-10-13 01:28  don

	* Removed personal note in Matrix header file

2001-10-12 20:06  robert

	* Added support for the new AttributeUpdateFunctors.

2001-10-12 20:05  robert

	* Added != method to Vec2,Vec3,Vec4 and did further work on the
	  AttributeUpdateFunctors.

2001-10-12 17:45  don

	* Added include/osg/Math to Makefile TARGET_INCLUDE_FILES and fixed
	  references
	  to _mat in ConvertToPerformer.cpp

2001-10-10 20:20  robert

	* Added support for DYNAMIC/STATIC osg::Transform types and added
	  new osg::Drawable::getStats
	  and supportsAttributeUpdate(..) and applyAttributeUpdate(...)
	  methods which will
	  be to enable hooks into Drawable subclasses.

2001-10-10 14:38  robert

	* Fixed spelling of osg::GeoSet::getNumInterleavedIndices, was
	  missing a 'n'!

2001-10-09 21:55  robert

	* Fixed a crash when opening an erroneous test file (reopen.bmp).

2001-10-09 20:22  robert

	* Updated to fix build problems under MSVC.

2001-10-09 20:09  robert

	* Updated MSVC Workspace files to fix build problems.

2001-10-09 20:03  robert

	* Updated MSVC Workspace files to fix build problems.

2001-10-09 14:18  robert

	* Merged Ben Discoe's clean up of the MSVC files.

2001-10-09 11:58  robert

	* Merged updates to BMP plugin from Geoff Michel. Also modified a
	  little of the
	  code to fix a crash under Linux, Robert Osfield

2001-10-08 19:01  robert

	* Put the makedefs.linux back to default to optimize.

2001-10-08 15:54  robert

	* Fixed a recently introduced crash in the flt plugin which was
	  happen when a
	  std::string was be be set with NULL char*. Also added support for
	  stripping
	  the filename from its original path, inside the osgDB::findFile
	  function.

2001-10-08 08:35  robert

	* Added support for using osgDB::fineFile into the .flt plugin.

2001-10-07 20:10  robert

	* Merged Geoff Michel's udpdates to bmp plugin, and fixed a double
	  fclose bug
	  which was causing a seg fault under Linux.

2001-10-06 20:29  robert

	* Added a osg::DegreesToRadians() and osg::RadiansToDegrees()
	  method to osg/Math,
	  updated the ReaderWriterBMP.cpp (mods sent in my Geoff Michel)
	  and
	  moved the osgUtil::Statistics to osg::Statistics in preperation
	  to adding it
	  to the the Drawable base class.

2001-10-05 19:55  robert

	* Added bmp plugin files, bmp plguin written by Geoff Michel

2001-10-05 10:39  robert

	* Added bmp osgPlugin, written by Geoff Michel.

2001-10-05 10:38  robert

	* Fixed a bug in osg::Image::ensureDimensionsArePowerOfTwo() which
	  only
	  scaled dimensions if *both* axis wern't a power of two, have
	  fixed it
	  to rescale if either of the axis arn't a power to two.

2001-10-05 01:27  bryan

	* *** empty log message ***

2001-10-04 16:49  robert

	* Added the Copyright message to the top of osgWX, with Ben Disoe's
	  name as
	  he wrote all the code.

2001-10-04 15:12  robert

	* Added a copyright notice to all core headers, which all begin
	  with
	  //C++ header to help scripts and editors pick up the fact that
	  the
	  file is a header file.

2001-10-04 14:39  robert

	* Changed the ordering of comparing modes and attributes in
	  osg::StateAttribute::compare() as part of an investigration into
	  state sorting.

2001-10-04 14:35  robert

	* Added an implemention of basic state sorting to the RenderBin,
	  but have commented
	  out the sort operation as Peformance benifit is currently
	  negligable, will need
	  to improve on the sort functor to see real benifits.

2001-10-04 14:25  robert

	* Added extra precision to the app,cull and draw timings in the
	  Viewer.

2001-10-04 14:20  robert

	* Removed some notify which were only used for debugging of the
	  camera class
	  and are now redudent.

2001-10-04 14:10  robert

	* Changed the numeric ordering of StateAttributes Types, as part of
	  an
	  investigation into state sorting.

2001-10-03 21:44  robert

	* Integrated changes for MacOSX, submitted by Phil Atkin, with
	  small mods by
	  Robert Osfield to maintain compatability under Linux.

2001-10-03 07:56  robert

	* Added missing EarthSky.cpp file to osg plguin.

2001-10-02 15:59  robert

	* Added include/osg/EarthSky and src/osg/EarthSky to cvs.
	  
	  Also move osg across to using radians for angular paramters by
	  default.
	  By defining USE_DEGREES_INTERNALLY you can get the OSG to revert
	  to
	  the old style degrees. This later feature is deprecated and only
	  meant
	  for helping comptability in the interim.

2001-10-02 11:36  robert

	* Added osg::EarthSky node to the core osg library, and added
	  support for it into
	  osgUtil::SceneView, osg::CullVisitor, osgPlugin/osg and updated
	  the hangglide
	  demo to use the new earth sky node.

2001-10-01 23:02  robert

	* Added support for osg::StateSet comparison operators and using
	  this new feature
	  added support in osgUtil::OptimizeStateVisitor for removing
	  duplicate
	  StateSet's from the scene graph, previously only duplicated
	  StateAttributes
	  we're removed.

2001-10-01 12:06  robert

	* Integrated a bug fix to osg::TexMat from Geoff Michel which adds
	  a
	  glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW ); after the setting of the texture
	  matrix.
	  Previously the texture matrix mode could run into normal model
	  view
	  matrix operations which were assuming the defaul of GL_MODELVIEW.

2001-10-01 11:15  robert

	* Made spelling corrections, the spelling mistakes picked up by a
	  script
	  written by Neil Salter.
	  
	  script

2001-09-30 20:41  robert

	* Interegrated changes to Timer from Neil Salter to fix compilation
	  problems which had been introduced by doing #include's within the
	  osg namespace.

2001-09-29 18:34  robert

	* Added setAttributeAndModes(new Depth,StateAttribute::ON);
	  to the StateSet::setGlobalDefault() so that the correct default
	  for the glDepthFunc etc are set up for scene graphs, and allows
	  override of these value which risk of inheriting state on to the
	  rest of the scene graph.
	  
	  This has allowed the hangglide demo to be simplified since it now
	  doesn't need to set the global Depth instance itself.

2001-09-29 09:37  robert

	* Modified the Matrix multiple method added by Don so it is safer
	  and added comments explaining why it shouldn't be needed as other
	  more efficient methods should be doing the work for us.
	  
	  Also added Matrix::ensureRealized() to support the lazy
	  initialization of Matrix, whilest keeping the implementation
	  robust so that external calls to Matrix which get values do so on
	  an initialized matrix.

2001-09-29 02:48  don

	* Added operator * (Matrix &) to Matrix (header) and
	  operator [] to reference matrix elements.

2001-09-28 20:10  robert

	* Made spelling corrections to osg include files, spelling mistakes
	  detected by a script written by Neil Salter which analyses
	  comments for mistakes.

2001-09-28 19:36  don

	* Synch with 20010921

2001-09-22 02:04  don

	* Added files to keep cvs from removing empty directories lib and
	  lib/osgPlugins

2001-09-20 01:07  don

	* Added place holder README files to lib/README and
	  lib/osgUtil/README so
	  empty directories will not be removed by CVS

2001-09-20 00:59  don

	* Removed Makedepend files

2001-09-20 00:48  don

	* Addec binary files with -kb

2001-09-20 00:47  don

	* Removed should be binary entries. Well r-add with -kb

2001-09-20 00:07  don

	* Added ico files with -kb flag

2001-09-20 00:06  don

	* Trying to clean up binary commits

2001-09-19 23:56  don

	* Added these with the -kb flag now.

2001-09-19 23:55  don

	* Cleaning up binary commits - oops

2001-09-19 23:52  don

	* 1) new implementation of the osg::Matrix class. Note details
	  below.
	  2) cleaned up osg::Timer, still in progress. My intent has been
	  to
	  pave the way for support for other OS's.
	  3) new osg::FrameStamp class which has a frame number, reference
	  time for each frame to be app, culled and drawn. The FrameStamp
	  also can be passed to other machines (i.e. cluster) and the
	  FrameStamp can be used with the slaves own app,cull and draw.
	  I've also added the beginings of a calander time data to the
	  FrameStamp to allow time or day and year to be used in setting
	  up position of sun/moon etc. etc.
	  4) The osg::State now has contains a pointer to the last applied
	  osg::Camera and the current osg::FrameStamp, so that drawables
	  can use both pieces of information for creating effects such
	  CLOD, earth/sky etc. The osg::NodeVisitor also now allows you
	  to attach a FrameStamp to support syncronization of actions on
	  the scene graph.

2001-09-19 23:46  don

	* o Added osgUtil::StateOptimizeVisitor which traversing the scene
	  graph and builds up a map of all StateAttributes and StateSets
	  and then removes the duplicates. This promotes state sharing
	  throughout the scene graph which inturn can significantly improve
	  performance thanks to reduced state changing. Particularily
	  effective on datasets where a great deal of duplicated state
	  exists.
	  o Added pure virtual compare(const osg::StateAttribute&)
	  method to osg::StateAttribute, and implemented it in all the
	  subclasses from StateAttribute. Added <,== & != operator
	  on StateAttribute and Matrix to support new StateOptimizeVisitor.
	  o Added META_Object, META_Node and META_StateAttribute macros to
	  Object, Node and StateAttribute respectively which define the
	  standard pure virtual methods such as clone, className
	  & isSameKindAs. Changed all the appropriate header files to
	  use these macro's rather define them in each header, these cleans
	  up the headers considerably.
	  o Corrected the implementation of osg::Light::getType so it
	  correctly
	  uses a unique type for each of the OpenGL lights (GL_LIGHT0..
	  GL_LIGHT7 relates to osg::StateAttriburte::LIGHT_0..LIGHT_7.
	  o Changed the definition of osg::StateStateAttribute::Type to
	  is now a unsigned int rather than an enum, and have changed the
	  name of the previous Type enum list to be Types. This makes it
	  more consistent with the difination of values found in
	  StateAttribute
	  and also easier to extend with having to cast to an enum.
	  o From Pail Fredrikson, updated Maitrx.new implemention which
	  uses
	  the same matrix orientation as the original Matrix implemention.

2001-09-19 23:41  don

	* o Updated Metrowerks files for MacOS. They aren't 100% there yet,
	  but getting there.
	  
	  o First cut of osgcluster demo. Very simple beginings. Alas
	  I only one PC here so I can't test it in its current guise.
	  
	  o New support for NodeCallbacks, via AppCallback attached to
	  osg::Node's, and a default osgUtil::AppVisitor which calls them
	  on
	  each frame.
	  
	  o Support for traversal masks in osg::NodeVisitor, osg::Node
	  which allows nodes to be switched on or off via a bit mask.
	  
	  o Suppport for traversal number (frame number) and reference time
	  into osg::NodeVisitor to handle syncronization of app and cull
	  traversals. This also assist clustering as traversal number
	  master to slaves.
