/*! \page bmps_in_memory drawing on Bitmaps in Memory
 *
 *   If you want to use bitmaps in memory and draw upon them,
 *   you have to follow these steps:
 *
 *   \li 1 Allocate a MemoryDC (this is a memory device context used for the drawing operations
 *         which a device context provides)
 *   \li 2 Create a CompatibleBitmap
 *   \li 3 Select this compatible Bitmap into the memory device context (the bitmap now becomes
 *         the surface for the drawing operations made onto the device context. Keep the
 *         return value for unselecting it again
 *   \li 4 do your drawings
 *   \li 5 unselect the selected bitmap
 * 
 *
 * See the following code for an example.
 *
 *   \code
 
  MemoryDC memDc;
  CompatibleBitmap compBmp(memDc, width, height);
  CStdBitmap oldBmp = memDc.Select(compBmp);
       
  // Your drawing operations go here
 
  memDc.Select(oldBmp);

 *   \endcode
