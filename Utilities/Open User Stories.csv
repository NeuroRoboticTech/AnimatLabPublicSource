Add playback control,2,0,1.50,AnimatLab V2 Upgrade,Build new Body plan editor,"",Good,Open,288,"Need the ability to specify a sleep millisecond period between time steps for the simulation. This will let the user control how fast the simulation plays back. However, we need to do this in a way that does not affect the graphics playback rate. In other words, the graphics screen rate needs to be fairly constant while the simulation slows down.

Free moving joint,2,0,1.50,AnimatLab V2 Upgrade,Build new Body plan editor,"",Great,Open,316,"Need a way to add parts together without having an actual joint constraint. An example of this would be a chain. The interaction between the collision geometries is all that is needed as a joint. I need to add a new joint type (FreeMoving). When created in the simulation it will simply not add a constraint between the parts.

Distance Joint Bug,2,0,3,AnimatLab V2 Upgrade,nUnit tests,"",Must Have,Open,903,"Found two bugs when building the test for the distance joint. I need to submit them to cm-labs to look at.
1. When starting a sim, if a block is over the top of its parent with a distance joint, then it initially falls straight down through the parent till it hits the joint limit. It then behaves normally.
2. When I charted the positions of the attached body it did not keep a consistent distance from the parent part.
