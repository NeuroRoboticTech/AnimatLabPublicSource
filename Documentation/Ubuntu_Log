cd media/Ubuntu_Data/Projects/AnimatLabSDK

installed openscengraph-3.0.1.2 from synaptics
(Need to test it)

Tried to build boost_1_54, but got command not found error. Found out that I need to get the source from the tarball instead of the zip because it keeps the linux permissions. Other option was to use chmod 755 bootstrap.sh to change permissions.

tried to build boost using the following command and got this error

/usr/include/features.h:324:26: fatal error: bits/predefs.h: No such file or directory

I was having trouble getting StdUtil unit tests to compile. It turned out it was because I got rid of the DYN_LINK define so it would compile in VS. I added this back with a ndef WIN32 define and it compiled on ubuntu now.
 
I got AnimatSim, BoostrapLoader, FiringRate, and IGF all compiling.

I tried to get OsgAnimatSim to compile and ran into an issue. It compiled fine, but it should not have. I installed osg 3.0.1.2 from synaptics, so it should have died because it did not have the MatrixManipulator class. So that meant it was not using the right includes and libs. When I did an ldd I confirmed that it was using the old 2.8.3 libs. The new include and lib files are directly in /usr/include and /usr/lib. The old ones are in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib64. I did some research and according to this page (http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.1/cpp/Search-Path.html#Search-Path) it does search local first. This is a problem because if someone has an old version of osg installed how do I ensure they link with the correct version? For the moment I have renamed all osg, osgworks, bullet and osgbullet include files under local with the prefix test_. I also moved all osg libs into a test_lib64 folder under /usr/local. Doing this I was able to compile and link OsgAnimatSim and confirmed that it is linking to the correct libs. However, one other annoying problem is that I have no debug libs to link against. The deb package only has the release versions.
