Instead, I ran the ubuntu installer directly form win7 and installed
onto sdd. Removed extra partitions first.

25. Made an image of both ubuntu and win7 disks
26. using software center installed fglrx-amdcccle (failed for some reason. I believe because the base drivers have not been installed yet.)
27. I found a utube video and it said to start "Additional drivers"
28. Then clicked on "ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver (Post-release updates)"
    and clicked activate.
29. installed "synaptic Package Manager" using software center
30. Checked the "additional driver" again and it says "No propriatary drivers in use"
    Also, says "Drivers activated but not in use"
31. Downloaded "amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86_64.zip" from amd website

41. used software center to install glmark2 and mesa gl utilities
42. My gl mark2 score is 2267. This seems really low compared to other scores I see on the net.

43. using software center I am installing xfce with optional add-ons. I want to see the graphics
performance with a lighter weight desktop without unity. I choose not to start HDD daemon on boot.
44. My glmark2 score in xfce is 2968. Better, but still not in the 8000's like other were reporting.


I screwed up when I was configuring the SATA connectors. The 2.5" disks were not connected
as disk 0 and 1. The data disk was disk 0, so even though I installed windows onto the 2.5" disk
it still put the MBR onto the data disk. So as it stands now I cannot boot without also making a
copy of the data disk that matches. I am going to reconnect the drives so that the 2.5" windows 
disk is drive 0 and then try and do a repair on the windows. I will most likely have to re-install
ubuntu at that point.

STARTING OVER
1. I put only one of the 2.5" disks in and installed windows on it.
It created 2 partitions autmatically. A system restore partition (1) and a regular (2)
2. Installed windows 7 as above.
3. Made a copy of the HD and tested. I also tested booting from second slot.
4. Installed drivers listed above. (2-14)
5. Installed LG Blue ray suite. However, do not install LG Toolkit anymore. Had to uninstall it.
It was causing a popup every time I rebooted.
6. Installed mcafee anti-virus from school. Took a long time to update. 
7. Removed mcafee anti-virus from school. It is too old and no longer supported. Will have to do something else
8. Installed ubuntu. Tried to install xubuntu desktop, but it failed. instead, installed regular ubuntu desktop.
9. (Keep ubuntu disk in when rebooting after install on windows and choose Install ubuntu)
10. Selected install 3rd padrty components and optional addins.
    Selected install alongside windows. Installed on sdb, kept default partitions
    It automatically ejects disk when done.
11. Installed glmark2 and tested with score of ~2300
12. Installed fxce4 with options
13. extracted AMT-APP-SDK. and ran it. I got an error about not being able to form a link
to libopencl.so. So there may be a problem with this.
14. I used synaptic to install the opencl headers
15. I shutdown, swapped the windows and ubuntu HDs and was able to reboot.

Windows
16. Installing visual studio 10 to C drive
17. Installed MS SQL Server 2008 R2 on C. Had the data storage folders point to F drive though
18. Installed Visio 2013
19. Installed office 2013
20. Installed git
21. Installed tortisegit
22. Installed inno setup
23. Installed mcafee anti-virus
24. Installed updates and updates and updates

Ubuntu
25. Access mounted drive through terminal. cd /media/Win7_Data
26. found out that I need to do a special mount of the win7_data drive in order to be able 
to execute scripts and stuff. Otherwise the permissions are all screwed up
(Command to find which drive) df
sudo mkdir /media/Win7_Data
sudo mount -t ntfs -o fmask=0022,dmask=0000,uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/sdd1 /media/Win7_Data
27. Copied Openscenegraph-2.8.3 folder from animatlabpublicsource to /home/dcofer and tried to run ./configure
For some reason it would not run directly. I had to actually take the command out of the file and run it by hand.
It seemed to work. However, when I did a make it only got to about a 11% and then had an error stating it could not 
find libGL.so. I was eventually able to find that this lib was in the mesa folder and it had a broken link. I fixed it
and dev-pkg was able to find it. However, when I tried to run make again it still failed.
I found out that if I delete the CmakeCache.txt it will cause cmake to rerun again. This time
it said it found libGL.so, but have not tried to run it again because a bunch of other stuff was missing.
28. Installed cmake-qt-gui using software center
29. used synaptics to install 
   libtiff4-dev
   libjpeg8-dev
   libgif-dev
   libpng12-dev
   libxml2-dev
   libfreetype6-dev
   curl
   libgdal1-1.7.0
   libgdal1-dev
   python-gdal
   libopenal1
   libopenal-data
   libopenal-dev
   librsvg-2-dev
30. I figured out that the libGL.so problem was real. Both of the files in /usr/lib/x86.../libGL.so and 
/usr/lib/x86.../mesa.libGL.so were broken links. Looks like fglrx renamed this so it was not used.
There is a valid version in the /usr/lib/fglrx folder. I initially tried to fix the links to point to this version
but could not figure it out. Instead, I just pointed cmake to this version of libGL.so and it started compiling
31. OSG compile got to about %80 and then died on the curl plugin. It was referencing a #include <curl/types.> file that
has been deprecated and removed in later versions. I found some documentation about this online that said to just
remove that include. I opened ReaderWriterCurl.cpp and commented out that line
32. OSG compile completed successfully.
33. I tried to install some microsoft core true type fonts and it hosed my gui. Completely locked up
I had to use ctr+Alt+F2 to get to command line and then do a sudo reboot.
34. The true type fonts were actually in the osg data lib, I just did not set the osg lib path correctly.
I did that and now can run the examples.
35. However, after making it halfway through the examples I was no longer able to open anymore. I got a
Maximum number of clients reached. not sure what is causing this right now
36. Redid cmake with the debug version and rebuilt OSG and installed it, and did ldconfig
37. Used software center to download doxygen with all options and installed
38. Ran cmake for osgworks2 and had it build into ubuntu_build folder.
39. Having trouble building the debug version. Even setting the build type manually to debug is not working.
40. Used software center to install regexxer search tool. 
41. I tried to manaully run cmake and specify the debug version, but it still failed. I am going to have ask someone on a forum or something.
42. Installed Automake from software center
43. Installed libtool
44. Installed libglew1.6-dev from synaptics
45. installed through synaptics
     libcppunit-1.12-1
	 libcppunit-doc
	 libcppunit-dev
46. Installed eclipse-cdt through synaptics
47. I think cmake was actually creating the debug version of the libraries, but just not putting on an extension
I found a CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTIFX=_debug setting that seemed to fix this.

cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_EXTRAS=on -DBUILD_DEMOS=on -DINSTALL_LIBS=on -DCMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX=_debug
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_EXTRAS=on -DBUILD_DEMOS=on -DINSTALL_LIBS=on
48. Figured out some more on how to use cmake gui. I can do the same thing as above if I simply add a new value to the cmake
for the CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX=_debug setting. Then I can generate out the make files using the gui.
49. One problem I ran into was that the linker for apps would not link correctly if it had a postfix on it. Not sure why.
I had to go in and to the link.txt files and manually change them to point to the location of the compiled .a/.so debug files
This allowed them to finish linking. Did not need to do this with the release versions.
50. used "sudo make install" to install each one of them.
51. To get admin rights in file explorer you need to run "sudo nautilus" from the command line.
To get to the home directory then use the go to menu item with location and specify /home/dcofer


Switched back to Windows
52. Downloaded git-credential-winstore.exe to store git credentials and ran it.
I needed to also add the prog files x86/git/cmd and git/bin dirs to my path
53. Regenerated .cproj files and booted back into ubuntu.

Swithced to Ubuntu
54. I had to comment out a few lines of code in the /usr/local/include/osg/math file to get rid of the 
isNaN error I found earlier. I added DWC comments on it. This allowed me to compile OsgAnimatSim fine.
55. I had to add /usr/local/include/bullet to the include files for BulletAnimatSim manually. Some of the
OsgBullet code was referencing it without the bullet/ extension and could not find it otherwise.
56. Found a crappy problem. When I tried to link BulletAnimatSim it gave me an error:
Relocaton R_X86_64_325 against 'vtable for osgbDynamics::MotionState' can not be used when makeing a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
I did some research and found out that if you want to compile a static library into a dynamic one then you need to
compile the static lib with the -fPIC option. It has to do with the ability of the code to be relocated correctly.
So I will need to recompile OsgWorks, Bullet and OsgBullet now. Ughh!!
In cmake I had to set the CXXFlags to -fPIC. This seemed to work.
However, I had to stop part way. I was part way through doing OsgWorks debug
57. I had to convert all the projects to remove the using namespace std; This was to prevent an
error when linking to osg on ubuntu. It had a namespace collision if you just included std generally.
58. Found out that I need to link AnimatSimulator with both dl and pthread for it to be able to 
open a dynamic library using dlopen. It locked up when calling dlopen if I did not have those libs.
59.
