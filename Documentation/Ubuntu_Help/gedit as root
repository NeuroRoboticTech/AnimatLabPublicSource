If you don't want to use a terminal, you can invoke a GUI program as root thus (this example is for Gedit):

    Hit Alt+F2 to bring up the Run dialog.

    Type gksudo followed by the executable name of your program (which might be different from the name displayed by the GUI). For example:

    gksudo gedit

    Hit Enter.
