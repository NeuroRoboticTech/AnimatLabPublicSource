To define this variable, simply use (on the shell prompt):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/dcofer/OsgWorks_2_0/lib

To make it permanent, you can edit the ldconfig files. First, create a new file such as:

sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/your_lib.conf

Second, add the path in the created file

/path/to/sdk/lib

Finally, run ldconfig to update the cache.

sudo ldconfig
